</div>

<p class="center">FOURTH NATIONAL CONSERVATION CONGRESS.</p>
<hr class="r5">

<p>The Fourth National Conservation Congress, made up of delegates
from all sections and from thirty-five States of the Union, met in the
City of Indianapolis, do hereby make the following declarations:</p>

<p>Recognizing the natural resources of the country as the prime basis
of property and opportunity, we reaffirm the declaration of the preceding
Congress, that the rights of the people in these resources are natural,
inherent, and inalienable; and we insist that these resources shall
be developed, used and conserved in ways consistent both with the current
and future welfare of our people.</p>

<p>We put chief emphasis on vital resources and the health of the people;
and since health and brains are the first and most important factors
of efficient life, we urge the adoption of all rational and scientific methods
which will lead to their building-up.</p>

<p>To be well born is the primal requirement, and the first step to make
sure that children shall be well born is to stop the multiplication of
those bearing hereditary defects of body and mind. We believe that
science is capable of solving the problem satisfactorily and that improvement
is possible under existing conditions. We earnestly urge its consideration
by the public.</p>

<p>We believe that every State should have wisely ordered health laws,
with officers empowered to enforce them, and also that a National Department
of Health should be created, comporting with the dignity and
importance of the cause. This department should work effectively for
the promotion of the physical and hence the moral and intellectual
health of the people.</p>

<p>The accurate registration of births and deaths, which has been called
the ‘Bookkeeping of Humanity,’ is a fundamental necessity for a study
and knowledge of disease, and for all public health work. Therefore,
we affirm our belief in the importance of vital statistics registration,
and recommend that all States now without proper vital statistics adopt
as early as possible the model bill for the registration of vital statistics
indorsed by the United States Bureau of the Census, and by many prominent
professional and scientific bodies.</p>

<p>We urge the strengthening of laws safeguarding the health and the
lives of workers in industrial establishments; and we commend to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
employers of labor all practicable safety devices and proved preventive
measures against illness and injury and physical inefficiency; and we
urge upon the other States the investigation of accidents by elevators
and the enactment of laws similar to those on the statute books of Pennsylvania
and Rhode Island.</p>

<p>We commend the activity of all individuals and organizations and
governmental agencies to put an end to such work by children and
women as impairs the health of the race. Childhood is our greatest resource,
and its right to protection in growing to a normal maturity is
inalienable. We deplore the ignorant use of medicines; and we call
upon all humane and educational agencies to teach the waste and danger
of any drug-habit.</p>

<p>We earnestly advocate the employment by communities and manufacturing
concerns of such methods of sewage disposal as will render their
waste products harmless to health and utilize them in the restoration of
soil fertility; and we urge the enactment by States of laws prohibiting
stream pollution and by the Federal Government of such legislation as
will prevent the pollution of interstate and coastal waters.</p>

<p>Uniform State legislation regulating the refrigeration of perishable
food stuffs is advisable, therefore this Congress recommends that its
Food Committee be requested to study the questions involved in the
production, collection, sanitary preparation, transportation, preservation
and marketing of perishable foods and to report its findings to the
succeeding Congress as a basis for uniform legislation.</p>

<p>In view of the enormous losses annually sustained by the agricultural
interests of the United States on account of the ravages of injurious
insects, which might be kept more under control by an increase of insect-eating
birds, we urge the passage of Federal laws for the protection
of all migratory birds; and the passage of State laws for the prohibition
of spring shooting and of the sale of game.</p>

<p>We reaffirm the great importance of our fishery resources, which are
threatened with serious diminution. We urge upon Congress and the
States to provide more liberally for the propagation and preservation
of food fishes.</p>


<p class="center">LANDS.</p>

<p>We keenly recognize the need of the people of the country for more
complete and accurate knowledge of their land and its conditions than is
now available, in order to promote their economic, social and intellectual
well-being and to conserve scattered individual energy;</p>

<p>We recognize that such data should be collected by a general series
of State and National surveys arranged in the order in which they will
be most accurate and effective and that many of these are already in
progress;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>This Congress earnestly points out the following kinds of data of
which the people have need and the approximate order in which it
should be collected, namely:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. A thorough geographical survey of public boundaries and cultural features.</p>

<p>2. Of the form or topography of the earth’s surface.</p>

<p>3. Of the geology, including the structure and economic deposits of the earth’s crust.</p>

<p>4. Of the kinds and distribution of soils in their relation to agricultural operations.</p>

<p>5. Of the climate in its local variations and relation to crops and industry.</p>

<p>6. Of the surface and underground water supply of the country
in its local and regional relation, including flood and storage
problems.</p>

<p>7. Of various biological, crop and forestry conditions and relations.</p>

<p>8. And of many other surveys of a more specialized character and
local application which may be adequately carried forward
on the basis outlined above.</p>
</div>

<p>We urge the several States and the Federal Government to examine
their existing agencies to determine whether they are completely and
effectively fulfilling these functions.</p>

<p>Further, we reaffirm the action of the last Conservation Congress in
approving the withdrawal of the public lands pending classification,
and the separation of surface rights from mineral, forest and water
rights, including water-power sites, and we recommend legislation for
the classification and leasing for grazing purposes all unreserved lands
suitable chiefly for this purpose, subject to the rights of homesteaders
and settlers, on the acquisition thereof under the land laws of the United
States; and we hold that arid and non-irrigable public grazing lands
should be administered by the Government in the interest of small stockmen
and home-seekers until they have passed into the possession of actual
settlers.</p>


<p class="center">FORESTS.</p>

<p>Believing that the necessity of preserving our forests and forest industries
is so generally realized that it calls only for constructive support
along specific lines—</p>

<p>We commend the work of the Federal Forest Service, and urge our
constituent bodies and all citizens to insist upon more adequate appropriations
for this work and to combat any attempt to break down the
integrity of the national forest system by reductions in area, or transfer
to State authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>Since Federal co-operation under the Weeks law is stimulating better
forest protection by the States, and since the appropriation for such
co-operative work is nearly exhausted, we urge appropriation by Congress
for its continuance.</p>

<p>We recommend that the Federal troops be made systematically available
for controlling forest fires.</p>

<p>Deploring the lack of uniform State activity in forest work, we
emphatically urge the crystallization of effort in the lagging States toward
securing the creation of forest departments with definite and
ample appropriations, in no case of less than ten thousand dollars per
annum, to enable the organization of forest fire work, publicity propaganda,
surveys of forest resources and general investigations upon which
to base the earliest possible development of perfected and liberally
financed forest policies.</p>

<p>We recommend in all States more liberal appropriation for forest
fire prevention, especially for patrol to obviate expenditure for fighting
neglected fires, and the expenditure of such effort in the closest possible
co-operation with Federal and private protective agencies; and also
urge such special legislation and appropriation as may be necessary to
stamp out insect and fungus attacks which threaten to spread to other
States. We cite for emulation the expenditure by Pennsylvania of
$275,000 to combat the chestnut blight, and the large appropriation by
Massachusetts to control insect depredation, and urge greater Congressional
appropriation for similar work by the Bureau of Entomology.</p>

<p>Holding that conservative forest management and reforestation by
private owners are very generally discouraged or prevented by our
methods of forest taxation, we recommend State legislation to secure
the most moderate taxation of forest land consistent with justice and
the taxation of the forest crop upon such land only when the crop is
harvested and returns revenue wherewith to pay the tax.</p>

<p>We appreciate the increasing support by lumbermen of forestry reforms
and suggest particularly to forest owners the study and emulation
of the many co-operative patrol associations which are doing extensive
and efficient forest fire work and also securing closer relations
between private, State and Federal forest agencies. Believing that
lumbermen and the public have a common object in perpetuating the
use of forests, we indorse every means of bringing them together in
mutual aid and confidence to this end.</p>


<p class="center">MINERALS.</p>

<p>We reaffirm the opinion of the last Conservation Congress that mineral
deposits underlying public lands should be transferred to private
ownership only by long-time leases with revaluation at stated periods,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
such leases to be in such amounts and subject to such regulations as to
prevent monopoly and needless waste; and that in case of doubt as to
availability of such mineral deposits, or while they are waiting exploration,
surface rights to the land should be transferred by lease only under
such conditions as to promote development and protect the public interest.
Natural and manufactured fertilizing materials should be limited
and regulated by law.</p>

<p>Since present conditions in the mining industry result in heavy and
unnecessary loss of life and great waste of natural gas, coal and other
mineral resources, we call to public attention the need of specific and
uniform laws for the betterment of these conditions—laws as rigid and
comprehensive as we enact for the protection of life and for the right
use of property in any other fundamental industry.</p>


<p class="center">WATER POWER.</p>

<p>We reaffirm the previously expressed belief of the Conservation Congress
than all parts of every drainage basin are related and inter-dependent,
and that each stream should be regarded and treated as a unit from
its source to its mouth.</p>

<p>Recognizing the vast economic benefits to the people of water power
derived largely from interstate and navigable rivers, we favor public
control of their water power development; and we demand that the use
of their water rights be permitted only for limited periods, with just
compensation in the interests of the people.</p>


<p class="center">COUNTRY LIFE.</p>

<p>We applaud the betterment of conditions affecting country life, such
as good roads, and organizations for co-operative buying and selling;
and we urge the study of rural credit systems whereby the farmer may
more easily borrow capital at a reasonable rate of interest.</p>

<p>We applaud the work of making rural schools fit rural needs.</p>


<p class="center">DR. W. J. McGEE.</p>

<p>We here place on record our sense of the deep loss by the country
through the untimely death of Dr. W. J. McGee, a member of a Committee
of this Congress, a scientific man of broad attainment, and of the
widest human sympathy, whose helpfulness in these Congresses and
many similar meetings will be sadly missed.</p>


<p class="center">THE EXHIBIT.</p>

<p>We mention with appreciation the work of the Committee on Exhibits,
Mrs. Philip N. Moore, Chairman, which made the instructive
health exhibit under the management of Dr. Winthrop Talbot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>We record our grateful appreciation of the hospitality and helpfulness
of the State Government of Indiana, and of the City Government
of Indianapolis; and of the Local Board of Managers, Mr. Richard
Lieber, Chairman; of the Reception Committee, Mr. Albert E. Metzger,
Chairman; of the Commercial and Industrial organizations which,
through the Commercial Club, made the Congress here possible; of the
State Board of Agriculture, and of the Claypool Hotel, for their helpful
courtesies and generous co-operation; and we thank the newspapers
of Indianapolis for their unusually generous and accurate reports.</p>

<p>We wish to assure the retiring President, Captain White, of the
heartiest appreciation of the Congress and of the country for his generous
and efficient administration of the complicated business of the
Congress; and Mr. Thomas R. Shipp, the Executive Secretary, for his
zealous labor and good judgment and skilful management; and Mr.
James C. Gipe, the Recording Secretary, for his energy and efficiency;
and Colonel John I. Martin, the Sergeant-at-arms, must add one more
vote of thanks to his ever-lengthening collection.</p>

<p class="center">ADDRESSES OF WELCOME.</p>

<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—On behalf of the State of Indiana, your fellow
citizen, the Honorable Charles Warren Fairbanks, will address the Congress
in words of welcome. (Applause.)</p>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fairbanks</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Indiana has
frequently been honored by the presence of conventions of national importance.
Our countrymen, engaged in various and vast pursuits and
in the consideration of a large variety of questions, religious, social,
fraternal, economic and political in their character, have assembled here
from time to time to take counsel together with respect to the subjects
engaging their particular attention, and to the advancement of our
common welfare.</p>

<p>Our State has a hospitality for all who are engaged in promoting
the moral, material and political well-being of our rapidly multiplying
millions. I will not be misunderstood, I know, when I say that we have
never more heartily welcomed to our midst any body of men than we
now welcome the Fourth National Conservation Congress. (Applause.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>We recognize in this great assembly one of the most beneficent agencies
for good which has taken on the form of systematic organization,
national in its scope. It is not sectional, but is as comprehensive in its
purpose as the ample limits of the Republic. It takes thought, not of
the few, but embraces within its generous purpose one hundred millions
of people of all conditions and without suggestion or partiality for white
or black, native or alien born. How vast and how vital the field of its
activities!</p>

<p>How full of promise such an assembly as this is! It is, Mr. Chairman,
a complete answer to the pessimist. No thought of commercial
gain has brought you here; a spirit of altruism, love of country and of
mankind has been the impelling motive which has caused you, at your
own expense, to leave the comforts of your homes and firesides and your
daily vocations to come here and deliberate upon great themes of larger
interest to the great community of which you are a part than to yourselves.</p>

<p>You hold no commission from the government, yet your service is
of profound importance to it. You are not public servants in a narrow
sense, but in a broad sense you freely serve the public in the best possible
way.</p>

<p>The lesson of men voluntarily devoting themselves to the betterment
of their fellows without the thought of sordid gain is a fine one and
must impress itself in a very vivid and beneficial way upon the minds
of others and tend to elevate the entire mass. What tends to impress
us with our interdependence and to stimulate a feeling of homogeneity
among us as this movement does is of incalculable benefit. It is a splendid
thing for people to fellowship together in this manner, to take counsel
of each other with reference to questions concerning the common
good. It shows that we are interested more in what concerns the great
body of the community than in what concerns ourselves.</p>

<p>General Harrison, gifted statesman and our fellow citizen, once very
happily expressed the fact of the strength of confederated numbers in
a good cause. He told of an engagement during the great Civil War
when he was colonel of an Indiana regiment that was fighting in the
midst of a woods and thicket. The enemy was pressing hard in front
and fighting every inch of ground with a desperation that was unsurpassed.
The Indiana regiment was feeling the shock of war in an extreme
degree, and was almost on the point of discouragement. They
felt they were fighting the battle alone. But in the course of time, as
they emerged into a savannah, they saw a New York regiment, with its
battle flags flying to the breeze; and over there another regiment from
Kansas, and a shout of victory went up all along the line, for they found
they were not a mere detachment, but part of a great army fighting for
a common cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>So it is a fine thing to feel that we are part of a great army fighting
for a common cause—for home and country, rather than detached units
fighting for ourselves. (Applause.)</p>

<p>Conservation is comparatively new in the vocabulary of our modern
domestic economy, but it is a great word. It has come to be one
of the greatest words of the human language from a practical standpoint.
It is a continent-wide word in America. Conservation in some
aspect of the subject touches every community, every city, every State
and every individual. In other words, in a vital degree, it touches the
welfare of one hundred millions of American citizens. Its importance
is just beginning to be appreciated. Great today, but greater tomorrow
in the progress of affairs. (Applause.)</p>

<p>A good Providence endowed us so abundantly with the prime necessities
of our being that we have not fully realized the fact that there
was either a possibility or danger of dissipating them. We were wont
to boast of our inexhaustible resources. Nature has been prodigal, and
we have been prodigal in the use and abuse of what she had so generously
placed at our hands.</p>

<p>The forests—how vast and how majestic! We were obliged to fell
them for the plow and the harvest, and for homes and cities. We came to
look upon them as in our way—obstructions to our progress, as in a certain
sense they were, but in a large way they were not. And we carried
the work of demolition to the danger point before we realized our
mistake. What nature had been centuries creating for us we frequently
recklessly destroyed in a day.</p>

<p>The soil, the primary source of human life and strength, was rich
beyond compare. In the laboratory of nature the chemical elements
had been so nicely compounded that, to use a familiar simile, the farmer
had only to tickle the land with a hoe and it laughed with the harvest.
In time, Mother Earth began to resent neglect and abuse, and the crop
yield diminished; but that mattered little to the unthinking, for there
were still vast areas of virgin soil and the food supply was adequate
to our needs. In the course of time, however, there were no unoccupied
lands to be pre-empted, no fresh soil for the asking.</p>


<p class="center">MILLIONS COME TO OUR SHORES.</p>

<p>Millions of men and women flocked to our shores every ten years
from every land beyond the seas, seeking home and opportunity; millions
every decade were added to our population at home by natural increase.
Students of statistics came to realize that in the face of an increasing
demand for food supply at home, regardless of the millions in
the Old World dependent upon our granaries, soil exhaustion was a
subject of very vital importance, a crime, if you please, not by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
statute, but by moral law; and this may be said with respect to the reckless
or ignorant dissipation of all our natural resources.</p>

<p>We are in a very real sense trustees of the fields and forests, mines
and other sources of wealth, not to use and abuse at our will, but rather
to use for our own reasonable necessities and then to transmit them unimpaired,
so far as possible, and if possible increased in life-sustaining
power, to our children. (Applause.)</p>

<p>By no other method can our civilization be perpetually maintained
upon the highest level and the Republic kept in the forefront of the nations
of the world. The man who owns and tills the soil, who owns
and fells the forest, who owns and mines the coal, has no moral right to
abuse his ownership; no one has a moral right to waste patrimony
which must support not only the owner but the man who is not the owner,
and whose continued comfort and existence must depend upon the wisdom
with which the owner of the soil and forest and mine uses them.</p>

<p>The importance of Conservation derives emphasis from the rapidity
with which our population grows. Our cities will not only multiply in
number, but their inhabitants will increase, population will become congested
everywhere, and the demand upon our natural resources will be
greatly increased. We have added nearly ninety millions to our population
in one hundred years. One hundred years ago we were small in
numbers compared with the older countries. We have outstripped all
but the older empires and republics of Continental Europe. Take Russia,
with her 172,000,000; take India, with 325,000,000, and China,
where they are building a republic upon the ruins of an empire, with
her 400,000,000, and the United States stands fourth in magnitude of
population among the nations of the world, having outstripped all but
these, and with the present ratio of increase, in one hundred and fifty
or two hundred years we will stand not the last of these great populous
countries. And what does this signify? It signifies that the great subject
of Conservation that you are taking hold of with such intelligent,
patriotic interest, will be the overmastering question then as it is today.
(Applause.)</p>

<p>Who can put a practical limitation upon a definition of Conservation?
Conservation of our natural resources does not go far enough. The
public health falls within the subject of Conservation in the fullest and
best sense, and that is susceptible of many subdivisions. Conservation
of the minds and morals, Conservation of our political institutions—all
of these and many more subjects of but little less importance engage
the attention of such men as are assembled here.</p>

<p>I understand, Mr. Chairman, that the human side of Conservation
is to receive particular emphasis in this Congress. I am glad it is so.
We have been so long concerned with the physical resources that we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
failed to give proper credit to really a larger aspect of Conservation.
As important as is the conservation of our natural resources, far more
important is the question of conserving the health, conserving the intellect,
conserving the morality of the one hundred millions of people
we have. (Applause.) I have known men who were more solicitous
regarding the health of a fine horse or dog than the health of the family.
I have sometimes seen (but not in any of the States from which
any of you come) ladies that had a more affectionate solicitude for a fine
cat or a fine poodle than for the members of her household. (Laughter.)
We are getting beyond that. We are coming to appreciate that
that greatest assets in the United States today are men and women, and
we must know how to conserve them.</p>

<p>There is manifest and gratifying awakening upon this subject
throughout the country. We have not begun to appreciate the possibilities
in this field. Men of science, the microscope, the laboratory and
carefully gathered and well-digested statistics have opened up a new
world to our vision. Physicians and surgeons have been exploring the
mysteries of the physical man and familiarizing themselves with the
perils of his environment and learning how to arrest the work of his
destroyer.</p>

<p>They have learned how to locate his worst enemies by the use of the
searching eye of the microscope, enemies who destroy more thousands
than those enemies who come with fleets and armies and flaunting banners.
It was not the Chagres river and Culebra cut which defeated the
French Company in the construction of the Panama Canal, but the
mosquito.</p>

<p>An American physician opened up the way to the completion of this
work of world-wide moment by destroying the insect which had successfully
defeated the French. The white plague, which takes such tremendous
toll annually, is now under siege from every quarter, and
science will in due time win a new victory in removing this scourge.
Better sanitation in cities, villages, schoolhouses, workshops, homes, on
farms and in cities, guarding our water supply against pollution, insuring
pure food and pure drugs and their better preparation, are a
few of the imperative requirements of the day. And when I speak of
pure food and drugs, Dr. Wiley comes to my mind. (Applause.) He
has to do with an aspect of practical Conservation that will entitle him
and his associates to perpetual remembrance in the United States. (Applause.)</p>

<p>These are all practical questions, the importance of which cannot be
over-emphasized. They concern the health and happiness of many millions
of people and the destiny of the Republic itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>


<p class="center">INDIANA NOT INDIFFERENT.</p>

<p>Indiana has not been indifferent to this great movement. It has
taken up the work of Conservation with full appreciation of its magnitude
and its direct bearing upon the present and future of the State.
Our interests are so diversified that our conservationists in all branches
of the movement find full opportunity for the exercise of their activities.</p>

<p>We have an agricultural college which is doing much to advance
agriculture, horticulture, stock raising and the like along advanced lines.
Farmers are being interested in the necessity of cultivation of the soil
and the importance of seed selection, drainage and the like. We have
farmers’ short courses instituted by the college which are proving of
immense value. We are conserving the health of the livestock upon the
farms. Sanitation has played an important part in this branch of
work, as it has upon the human side.</p>

<p>We have a board of forestry supported by the State, and a Forestry
Association organized by the people; also a commission to protect the
food supply of our lakes and streams. These are only a few of the evidences
of our progress in Conservation.</p>

<p>We are conserving with particular care the health of our school children
with admirable results. We have learned, somewhat slowly perhaps,
that sound bodies and sound minds should and can go together,
and that to educate the mind and allow the body to become diseased is
false economy on the part of the State and is nothing short of a crime,
committed through either our ignorance or indifference.</p>

<p>We have sought to guard against and cure occupational diseases
which impair and disqualify so many wage earners. We have more and
more sought to throw around them such safeguards as well protect them
against injury and death, and then to provide an adequate measure of
compensation in case of accident as one of the legitimate burdens upon
industry of the community which ultimately rests upon the public.</p>


<p class="center">HAVE REDUCED ACCIDENTS.</p>

<p>During the last fifteen years we have made much advance in the
conservation of the health of our people. By rigid factory inspection
we have reduced accidents to our workmen from machinery and by improved
sanitation we have protected their health. We have also rigidly
inspected our mines with like results.</p>

<p>In fifteen years diphtheria has decreased sixty per cent., consumption
has decreased in this same period six to eight per cent.; deaths
from typhoid fever have fallen in the last two years from almost two
thousand to 936 in 1911. Education, better living, improved sanitation,
and an efficient State Board of Health, with its excellent organization
of health officers in every locality, the co-operation of the press in the
education of the people and support of our health officers, have accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
a great work in increasing in a very considerable degree the
health, vigor and happiness of our people.</p>

<p>The net result of it all is told in the vital statistics of the State. In
the last fifteen years the duration of life has been increased from 38.7
years to 44.6 years.</p>

<p>We are advocating the creation of a State Conservation Board with
supervisory power over all subjects of Conservation now committed to
separate and independent boards or commissions, so as to more effectively
co-ordinate their efforts in a scientific manner, avoiding duplication
and intensifying the work. It is suggested that a building be
erected by the State for the proper accommodation of the entire Conservation
service.</p>

<p>We regard this as a matter of great importance, and there is no
doubt whatever that the State will liberally respond to the prevailing
sentiment in favor of broadening the work of Conservation. It never
pursues any parsimonious policy in supporting whatever concerns the
education, health, moral safety and welfare of our people, so far as this
may be appropriately accomplished under the law.</p>

<p>It is not inappropriate in this presence to observe that the Conservation
of our political fabric must not be left out of consideration. This
is a matter we must always hold uppermost in our minds, lest we allow
harm to come to our priceless heritage.</p>

<p>Partisan utterance would, of course, contravene good taste, and I
shall not offend against it; but I may suggest with propriety that we
should hold fast to the fundamental principles of republican government,
which have been our guaranty of liberty and human rights and
of orderly progress for a century and a quarter.</p>

<p>The political wisdom of our forefathers has been abundantly vindicated
in our experience. Older countries in continental Europe and
in the Orient are turning toward us more and more and fashioning their
political institutions after ours.</p>

<p>We need not be quick to surrender the present well-tried guaranties
we have of justice and the rights of men for theories which neither
upon good reason nor upon experience are commended to our best judgement.</p>

<p>The program which lies before you is full of the promise of entertainment
and instruction. Men of wide experience, students of our
economic and social needs, will lay before you the rich fruit gathered
by them in the fields of their activities. Specialists in many branches
of the great work of Conservation will make you their debtors. I shall
not, of course, attempt to anticipate the subjects upon which they will
enlighten you.</p>

<p>Custom, my friends, alone has led me to make the observations in
which I have indulged in extending you welcome on behalf of the State<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
of Indiana. It is quite unnecessary to occupy your time in discharge
of this pleasant duty, which but for his enforced absence would have
been performed by the distinguished Governor of the State.</p>

<p>You would understand me, I know, if I merely said “Welcome.”
You would know that it was no perfunctory utterance, but that it came
from the bottom of the Hoosier heart. In a sense we do not look upon
you as our guests; we prefer to regard you as members of our household.
(Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The thanks of the delegates, the thanks of the visitors,
and the thanks of the people of the United States are due and will
be given to the Hon. Charles W. Fairbanks for this most intelligent
address, this statement of the principles that lie at the heart of every
true conservationist. (Applause.) He has taken a forward step, he
has led in the great movement in his own State, and he is now president
of the Indiana Forestry Association.</p>

<p>I want to say that it is very fortunate for the people of the country
that this address, and others that will follow, will be published and sent
broadcast over this great land. We are going to teach the principles
of conservation in every home.</p>

<p>It is now fitting that the next speaker should be also a conservationist—a
conservationist of a different type, but no less a true conservationist,
for at his hands, through his work, has come to the City
of Indianapolis a reduction in fire loss from $600,000 to $300,000 annually.
He is President of the Merchants’ and Manufacturers’ Insurance
Bureau, and has practiced conservation in a most practical manner
by reducing the fire loss and saving money to the people. We who have
investigated that subject in Germany and other countries know how
necessary it is that it should be brought home to us here in our cities
and our homes. I now have the pleasure of introducing to you the Chairman
of the Local Board of Managers, Mr. Richard Lieber. (Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address of Welcome for the City of Indianapolis</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lieber</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: It is a very
great pleasure and a distinguished honor to welcome you to our city
upon this auspicious occasion. The City of Indianapolis deeply appreciates
your coming and knows that through participation in your assemblages
and deliberations it will materially profit in those matters
which are of such vast and comprehensive benefit to its citizens. From
here, through your able and learned speakers, potential knowledge will
be disseminated throughout the length and breadth of our beloved country,
which, in its application, will increase the happiness, contentment
and usefulness of our people.</p>

<p>You have come here to consider most serious problems regarding
the conservation of national wealth, more particularly that of vital resources,
and above all, the conservation of human life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>For that reason, coupled with our welcome, is our expression of thanks
for your coming, for “your worth is warrant of your welcome.”</p>

<p>The thought of conservation is comparatively new. It marks a new
era in the development of the country, and nowhere are its lessons
more intensely needed than in a country like ours, vast in its expanse,
relatively sparsely populated and apparently inexhaustible in its natural
riches.</p>

<p>But are these riches inexhaustible? Can we go on in the manner of
our fathers and forefathers, who frequently had to destroy in self
defense?</p>

<p>Not since the days of the migration of nations, not even since the
legendary days of the fall of Troy has the world witnessed anything like
this stupendous conquest of a virgin continent. It is an intensified Iliad
of modern days. No comparison with former ages can suffice. What
are even the wondrous tales of Moses’ messengers of the great land
where “floweth milk and honey” compared with the gigantic proportions
and abounding riches of this modern promised land?</p>

<p>That the pioneer, coming to this land was destructive before he could
be constructive is a matter of historical truth. It could not have been
otherwise. He fought civilization’s battle, that civilization may enjoy
peace and prosperity. But some of these destructive habits of the settler
have taken root in our being and destruction has continued where
construction was needed. What have the American people not wasted!
Land and water, fish and game, coal, natural gas and too many other
riches. Above all, how many useful and dear lives are drawn into the
surging maelstrom of our national waste through indifference, carelessness
and greed!</p>

<p>We find ourselves confronted here with the anamorphosis of civilization.</p>

<p>Human sacrifice belongs to a dark and unenlightened day, but the
human sacrifice in mills and mines, in railroads and sweatshops in our
time is a dark blot upon our civilization. (Applause.)</p>

<p>In this mad chase after things material at any cost, we must pause,
for a nation will become unbalanced in its natural progress if its spiritual
and intellectual advance be retarded.</p>

<p>Conservation wishes to bring about a more harmonious blending of
these national needs. It teaches a wholesome regard for created values,
it preaches the sanctity of a child’s life and the economic value of our
boys’ and girls’ health, and aside from general consideration where is
an application of conservation ideals and principles more needed than
in our cities. We must learn that a good man’s or woman’s example
in the community is more beneficial and of greater force than a mere
ordinance. Virtue, righteousness and high principle spring from the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>seen of teaching that has fallen in mind and heart; they are inculcated
but cannot be legislated. (Applause.)</p>

<p class="center fs80">PRESIDENT, FIFTH NATIONAL CONSERVATION CONGRESS</p>


<p>Would it not in this connection be braver for us fathers and mothers
to speak openly to our boys and girls concerning the dangers that beset
them in their course of life end thus turn the energies of their lives into
the board avenues of light, strength and usefulness than to let them be
drawn into the abysmal chasm of a veritable hell of human waste.
Would it not be better to save, to lessen the inflow, than to clog the
mouth of this human sewer by police orders after prudery, hypocrisy
and cowardice have filled it? (Applause.) We are everlastingly treating
symptoms instead of diseases, attacking effects instead of causes,
and we persistently thereby aggravate the malady.</p>

<p>Let us have more light of thought, more air of true freedom and a
deeper and more sympathetic understanding of our own needs and
those of our fellow man that we may be enabled to show the folly of
vice, the contentment of virtue; that we may alleviate pain and want,
and that the warmth of human sympathy may send hope to the hopeless,
courage to the faltering and faith to the despondent.</p>

<p>With these fervent wishes the City of Indianapolis welcomes the
Fourth National Conservation Congress. (Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—These words of welcome, coming from a different
point of view, are felt deeply by us all. We feel the spur of duty still
greater.</p>

<p>It is very fitting that another side of conservation should be heard
from. The business men, the local business organizations of a city have
done a good work for conservation. Human efficiency is one of the
greatest forces that move the world, and systematic organization is one
of the greatest powers towards efficient conservation of life and of all
material progress. A business man knows that his success depends upon
perfect organization, and that perfect organization is just as necessary
to the conservation of every natural resource.</p>

<p>I have the pleasure of introducing to you Mr. Winfield Miller, of
Indianapolis, who speaks on behalf of the local business organizations.
(Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address on Behalf of the Local Business Organizations</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: When I was
honored by the commercial organizations of Indianapolis with the invitation
to extend for them a few words of greeting and welcome to this
National Conservation Congress, I looked into the biggest book, the
Dictionary, for a definition of the word “Conservation.” I found the
word concisely defined to mean “the art of preserving from decay, loss
or injury.” While the definition is not extended, it is comprehensive
and can be readily amplified to cover every phase of the question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>I then turned to the greatest book, the Bible, and read that early
edict which still holds good, “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread.” Over this ancient decree and its cause, there have been volumes
of theological commiseration, but in the light of subsequent history,
it is now generally agreed that man has been a greater force in the
garden of the world that if he had remained in the Garden of Eden.</p>

<p>The thought occurs, however, that resting under the edict of life-long
toil man would, from an early period, have practiced conservation
in all things. But he soon discovered that “the earth and the fulness
thereof” were his, and, as ever, has been injuriously careless of results.</p>

<p>Again, he was not left without hope. The same great authority, in
language and grandeur of thought unsurpassed, gives a promise of perpetual
inspiration, in this, that “While the earth remaineth, seed time
and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and
night shall not cease.” This promise, according to accepted chronology,
has the confirmation of forty centuries of time and gives man the assurance
of a continued field in which to do his work. The earth, the
air, the waters are his environment; they are immutable, unchangeable.
The animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms furnish him food,
clothing, shelter, life. Their best use should be his first and highest
consideration.</p>

<p>Nature has been prodigal in her gifts to man. Her kingdoms have
been his to rightfully exploit. But too long and too often has selfish
and neglectful exploitation been his purpose and practice.</p>

<p>There is abundance for all if nature’s forces are properly conserved
and her products fairly distributed. But some men, in their greed and
haste, have grabbed a thousand-fold more than their necessities or happiness
required. They eat their bread in the sweat of the other man’s
face. On the other hand, the many have been ignorantly neglectful of
the opportunities of their environments—so that life presses hard, too
hard. Avarice, ignorance, waste, have linked arms to the detriment
of civilization.</p>

<p>We must strive for the necessities of food, clothing and shelter.
These sustain animal life, which is worth while; but animal life, endowed
with the highest moral and mental strength, is the goal to be
reached, for the summit of man’s ambitions should shine with human
comfort and happiness. Conservation is the road to that summit and
this National Congress has convened to further blaze the path and light
the road. (Applause.)</p>

<p>Inventions of the last century, mostly within the half century, have
injected into the field of travel and communication means that excite
profound admiration; chemical analysis of the air and soil have shown
that the food supply of the world, if nature’s forces are properly conserved,
is without limit; while the mighty strides made in the better<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
understanding of the physical needs of man himself insure the race at
large improved health and longer life.</p>

<p>May I briefly indulge in a few common illustrations? The telegraph,
the telephone, the automobile, steam and electric power save time and
shorten distance. In that part of commerce relating to traffic we have
caught the spirit of conservation. The railroad builder no longer takes
the route of the least resistance in construction, but applies the geometric
proposition that the straightest line is the shortest distance between
two given points, works to that end, meets the difficulties of engineering,
reduces gradients, and practically builds his road along the
line of least resistance, conserves time, saves energy, increases efficiency
and lessens rates.</p>

<p>The school books tell us of the “Seven Wonders” of the ancient
world—the Pyramids, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, and so on; all
to gratify the vanity of kings and queens; not one for the advancement
of civilization.</p>

<p>In a little more than two years the dream of four centuries will be
realized—the Panama Canal will be completed. The distance from the
Occident to the Orient will be shortened seven thousand miles—the truly
modern wonder in advancing civilization and practical conservation.
(Applause.)</p>

<p>While the physical aspects of this mighty work, as they relate to the
traffic and commerce of the world, stand out in bold relief, but little
less, if any, in achievement, is the practical demonstration that scientific
sanitary methods can clean the plague spots of the world and make
them healthy and habitable for man.</p>

<p>Who can compute the saving of time and energy this mighty work
will bestow on the generations to come. Long after the passions of this
generation have ceased, history will record the names of the strong men
who have brought to full consummation this great waterway, as true
benefactors of mankind.</p>

<p>At this time, our public press is ecstatic over the great harvests of
1912 that promise such abounding prosperity. Some writers are so
extravagant as to say that the bountiful yields from our soil make an
epoch in history. To speak of one crop only, the corn, or Indian maize
crop, spreads over 108,000,000 acres, and is estimated to be 3,000,000,000
bushels. How enormous! At fifty cents a bushel, its money value would
be $1,500,000,000, or $16.00 to every man, woman and child in the
United States. Measured in bread, there would be enough to give to
each of our 93,000,000 of people a five-cent loaf for more than 320 days,
or nearly one full year. As gratifying as this is, the average yield is
only twenty-seven bushels per acre; while it is shown that, by proper
selection of seed, cultivation and fertilization of the soil, easily twice
the yield could be produced, which would double the benefits enumerated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>How often do we pass a barren field, the soil too impoverished to
grow wire grass, nettles, or thistles. The every-day farmer will tell you
that a crop or two of clover will restore the necessary plant life to the
soil of that field, and again make it blossom like the rose. He knows
from practical observation and experience the cure, if he cannot scientifically
trace the cause of the transformation.</p>

<p>Truly truth is stranger than fiction. Back of the restoration of a
thousand barren fields restored to productiveness in the simply way
named, lies one of the world’s greatest romances in patient scientific investigation
that will continue to bring untold benefits to mankind. You
know the story of Professor Nobbe, of Forest Academy, Germany. He
also knew that clover and other legumens of the plant family would
restore fertility to the soil. But why? After long and exhaustive
study, labor and experiment, he found that the clover family were nature’s
chemist of the soil; that by an invisible, intangible cord of attraction
they drew from the inexhaustible reservoir of the air nitrogen
so necessary to plant and animal life.</p>

<p>We are told that “nitrogen is what makes the muscles and brain of
man; that it is the essential element of all elements in the growth of animals
and plants, and, significantly enough, it is also the chief constituent
of the gunpowder and other explosives with which the wars of the
world are waged. The single discharge of a 13-inch gun liberates
enough nitrogen to produce scores of bushels of wheat.”</p>

<p>Some day, through this agency, man may turn his attention entirely
from war to the production of food, and in that hour true conservation
of life will have reached its triumph.</p>

<p>We are further told that four-fifths of the air we breath is nitrogen,
and that four-fifths of the atmosphere around us is nitrogen, so that
if mankind dies of nitrogen starvation, it will die with food everywhere
in and about it.</p>

<p>So that, while the human race may be but from three to six months
behind abject starvation, the fact begins to appear that through science
“mankind has just begun to sound the world’s capacity for food production
and that it is practically limitless.”</p>

<p>The proper conservation of the soil by the application of the research
of scientific discovery means increased yields of all plant crops, with
but little greater expenditure of energy. This would enable the producer
of food and clothing to sell more pounds, bushels and yards at
less cost, and still reap as great reward for his labor as at present. This
would forestall the Malthusian doctrine that population increases faster
than the means of subsistence and, still better, would help to solve the
high cost of living that presses so sorely upon the millions throughout
the world today. Man is a productive machine; so the more machines
of the highest type the world possesses the better for the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>This conservation movement that is so strongly taking hold of the
minds of thinking men and women, is so big, so broad and so comprehensive
that it covers every phase of human thought and activity in
what is best and highest for the individual as well as organized society.
It is education in the broadest sense.</p>

<p>The Golden Rule is not only a statement but a living principle.
To teach that a just distribution of nature’s gifts to each individual
who is willing to earn and conserve his share is a recognition of that
principle.</p>

<p>The City of Indianapolis esteems it a high honor to have this Congress
with us. To all of its members, and especially to the distinguished
men from other lands who have come to give us their best thought upon
the various questions affecting this great movement, we extend our most
cordial welcome and greeting, and our deep appreciation of your
presence.</p>

<p>Our commercial organizations also cordially join in holding the door
of welcome and hospitality open to you, and bespeak for your deliberations
their kindest sympathy and deepest interest.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">President’s Address</span></h3>
<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—This is a proud day for the officers of this Congress,
for its delegates from the different States, and for the friends of
Conservation everywhere, to be welcomed so hospitably, not only for
ourselves who are strangers within your gates, but generously because
of your sympathy in the great cause for which we stand. The citizens
of your great city are noted for their public spirit, for their broad culture,
and as being always found in the van with the army of those of progressive
ideas. It is very fitting that the State of Indiana should have this
Congress within its borders because of the immense interest shown and
all the valuable help given by its citizens in the conservation of all natural
resources, especially of human life and soil fertility.</p>

<p>To become the best, to do the best for all in a community, we must
each develop the best within us, and must find our greatest reward in
something far beyond the mere accumulation of dollars. Our community
of interests recognizes a reciprocity of duty each to and for the
other. Our title to the regard of our fellow men must come from our
devotion to them and our love of humanity and its highest ideals, and
not from selfish zeal in accumulating monetary wealth, which only represents
the toil, the waste, and the necessities of human lives. This has
been and is the age of commercialism. The measure of success has been
gauged by the amount of money accumulated. In the language of Goldsmith,
our country was in danger of descending to a condition “where
wealth accumulates and men decay.” But I believe a turning point has
been reached; and that we are entering upon a new era, a more glorious
conception of higher duties for mankind; so that it shall not be asked:
“What hath he taken from others in the competitive struggle for existence,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
but rather: “What hath he given to others of himself for their
advancement and development?” He who lives only for himself and
does not plant for those that are to come after him, lives in vain. I
believe the time is near at hand when a man shall be regarded with pity
and as very poor indeed, who has nothing but money selfishly gained for
selfish use.</p>

<p>The Conservation Congress of the United States has a great field to
occupy. Its labors are for the betterment of its citizens in every way.
Its work is to seek for the best methods to do the greatest good to all
for this and for future generations. And in this there is no partisan
politics; but it is such good national politics, that each party will strive
only in seeking for the best methods for the common good.</p>

<p>Human life, with its possible attainments, is far beyond valuation in
money. We should reverse the tables; and instead of human life being
estimated in dollars, the dollar should be valued only for what it can do
for greater humanity. Dr. Holmes, Director of the United States Bureau
of Mines, in illustrating waste of material resources, says that in
producing one half billion tons of coal, we waste or leave underground
one quarter of a billion tons. And then only eleven per cent of the energy
in coal is utilized; nearly ninety per cent is lost through inefficiency
of boilers, engines and dynamos. How great a per cent. are we
wasting of human life and human efficiency? We will have abundance
of all the necessaries of life, and even of life itself, if we wisely save,
wisely develop and protect, and wisely use. Human life is our greatest
asset, and its waste is a permanent loss. The wealth of the nation is in
its men, thrifty, honest, capable and patriotic men—in their moral and
physical health, the foundation of their highest efficiency. The milestones
of a nation’s progress are recorded in the history of every generation.
In India, the average duration of life is twenty-five years; in
Sweden more than fifty years; in the State of Massachusetts (the State
where most careful records have been taken) it is over forty-five years.
Wherever sanitary and highest medical science has been applied, it has
been found possible to increase the span of life. In Europe it is said to
have doubled in three and a half centuries. The report from Massachusetts
shows an increase of fourteen years in the past century. So
this humanitarian cause is surely a most economic, worthy and profitable
one. In figuring from the standpoint of capital, Prof. Mayo Smith estimates
that men and women between fifteen and forty-five years of age
are worth an average of one thousand dollars. But figuring from a
human standpoint, they are worth all that there is, money being only
one of the tools to work with in effecting exchange of commodities, and
the products of brawn and brain. We want to increase the ratio of the
value of man to the soil, of man to all and any of his products, of man
to money, and to put man first all the time. (Applause.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>We will increase the fertility and productiveness of the soil and we
will enlarge the scope and increase the efficiency of the man. We waste
in production as well as in consumption. In agriculture we will say
that we will make the soil produce so many bushels per acre per man.
The man will be first in his wise application of labor and methods and
of means to an end. The “limits of subsistence” under what political
economists used to call their “law of diminishing returns” has no fear
for the conservationist. The developing of human intelligence is enlarging
the production of the soil. Irrigation, where possible, and where
impossible the science of what is called dry farming brings increasing
results. Old farms in Europe produce more than they did 300 years
ago, and this will prove true with us, and there will be no starvation for
the human race because of increasing population.</p>

<p>And so will it be with all other industries, occupations and professions.
He will be greatest who accomplishes most for man. For the
brotherhood of man was the world made and the fullness thereof. Such
freedom as may benefit any individual and does not in any way work to
the injury of others is natural justice to all. Competition shall be robbed
of the “red tooth and the bloody claw,” and co-operation and development
for the good of all shall be the supreme object of all our efforts.</p>

<p>We will protect our watersheds by growing forests, and learn to
control our floods, prevent soil erosion, and store the water, and convert
its power into electricity, and from electricity produce light, heat
and power in undiminishing quantity forever. In nearly every State
there is daily flowing to waste power enough, if arrested and utilized
on its way to the sea, to turn every wheel of industry and to move the
traffic of commerce, and furnish light and heat for every city. It is said
that the wheel does not turn with water that is past, but other wheels
farther down the stream do, and the power is used again and again and
finally pumped back by the sun to the mountains and plains to forever
repeat the process of service to mankind. New discoveries are being
made, and the use for by-products is being multiplied so that they are
often found to be of greater use than the product from which they are
derived. We must protect our forests by preventing forest fires. Government
and State appropriations must be made sufficient for this purpose.
In the report of the Conservation Commission to the President,
it is stated that fifty million acres are burned over annually, and since
1870 there has been lost each year an average of fifty lives and fifty
million dollars’ worth of timber. The lumbermen’s interests are to prevent
fires and to stop waste; and they are anxious to co-operate with
the State and with associations for this purpose, and are already doing
so in many places. The true, saving features of forestry are becoming
better understood, and better applied; and we will save our forests, and
will grow trees, wherever necessary and profitable, the same as any other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
crop; and there will be no timber famine in the near or distant future.
Our foresters are studying the experience of France, Austria, Italy,
and Switzerland, coupled with our own experience, and we are making
successful progress. In Kansas five years ago, according to President
Waters of the State Agricultural College, there was only one school
that taught agriculture. Now nearly five hundred high schools and
more than six thousand rural schools are teaching the principles of
agriculture, forestry and domestic science.</p>

<p>The Commissioner of Internal Revenue reports that for the official
year 1912 ending June 30, the people of the United States drank more
whisky and rum and smoked more cigarettes than ever before in its
history. The smoking of over 11,221,000,000 cigarettes exceeded the
record of 1911 by nearly two billions. Does this make for or against
human efficiency? In this huge traffic is it the man or the dollar that
stands first in importance? Popular education will be the source of
protection, that all may have a fair chance for a useful life. There are
other great factors of vice and crime leading to national decay. Also
there is the enormous waste of human life by our railroads, mills, mines
and factories amounting to tens of thousands annually, and those permanently
injured and made a burden to themselves and to society to
tens of thousands more. In no civilized country in the world is this
loss anywhere near as great in proportion to work accomplished as in
the United States. The greatest part of this immense loss can be prevented.
(Applause.)</p>

<p>Here is thought and work for those in the department of vital statistics
and those in charge of our health departments, who are laboring
for the conservation of human life. Surely there is a great moral and
economic need for this national organization. May this Congress,
which now begins the work of its program, prove to be another step in
advance of its predecessors in the labor of love and of progressive activities.
The work in this vineyard is for both men and women; for
him with one talent as well as for him with ten talents. Conservation
should be taught in our schools and preached in our churches. It is a
call of and for all the people.</p>

<p>In the language of the official call of this Congress, the objects of this
Congress are “to provide for discussion of the resources of the United
States as the foundation for the prosperity of the people; to furnish
definite information concerning the resources and their development,
use and preservation, and to afford an agency through which the people
of the country may frame policies and principles affecting the conservation
and utilization of their resources and to be put into effect by their
representatives in State and Federal governments.” (Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The preliminary organization has now been completed.
It was expected that the President of the United States would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
be present to honor this occasion, at the opening of this Congress, or it
was at least hoped that it would be possible for him to do so, but
before he knew that he would send a personal representative he wrote a
letter of greeting to the Congress, which I will now read:</p>


<p class="center">MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:right;">Beverly, Mass., September 7, 1912.</p>

<p class="center">Hon. J. B. White, President National Conservation Congress, Bemus
Point, N. Y.:</p>

<p>My Dear Mr. White: Inasmuch as I have had to deny myself the
pleasure of being present at the opening of the National Conservation
Congress on October 1st, I want to take this means of conveying to the
officers and delegates my very cordial greetings and good wishes for a
most enthusiastic and instructive session.</p>

<p>You who know of my very real interest in the conservation of our
national resources need no assurance of my hope that your meeting in
every way may be a success, and I only want to say that that interest
has not diminished in the slightest.</p>

<p>May your deliberations be productive of great good in promoting the
cause of Conservation and in enlisting public interest in the solution of
the problems which must be met in giving the people of the present day
the benefit of the nation’s resources, while at the same time insuring to
posterity its full heritage.</p>


<p class="center">Sincerely yours,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;">WILLIAM H. TAFT.</p>


<p>It was afterwards found possible for the President to be represented
personally, and he has sent the Honorable Henry L. Stimson, Secretary
of War, to represent him here at this Congress. I now take pleasure in
introducing to you Secretary Stimson. (Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, Hon. Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War</span></h3>
<p class="center">ADDRESS BY THE SECRETARY OF WAR.</p>

<p class="center">(Representing the President of the United States.)</p>

<p>Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the National Conservation
Congress: I unite very sincerely in the congratulations which the former
speakers have tendered to you on your assembling here in such an important
and such a noble cause.</p>

<p>I am very happy to be here as the representative of President Taft—happy,
both because of the interest which I know he feels in the great
movement for Conservation, and also because of my own personal association
with and enthusiasm for that movement. Four days ago, when I
was busily engaged in inspecting one of the army posts of northern
Wyoming, in the far away Rocky Mountains, I received an urgent telegraphic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
request from the President, that I should come here today and
attend your meeting on his behalf. And the 1,600 miles or more which
separate Fort Yellowstone from Indianapolis, may serve at the same time
as a measure of the President’s interest in your meeting, and a measure
of the depth of my own unpreparedness to speak to you today. I know,
therefore, that you will understand and pardon me if I talk to you rather
informally, merely as one friend to others interested in a great common
cause, and confine the brief remarks which I shall make to one of the
phases of Conservation with which I have become familiar through the
work of the War Department.</p>

<p>Parenthetically, I might say that inasmuch as the Department of War
is not usually considered as a particularly appropriate agency for the
conservation of life, I will have to hark back to the material side of Conservation
in some of its aspects which have been presented at your former
meetings.</p>

<p>Of course, the main work which the Federal Government performs in
regard to Conservation is done through the Department of the Interior.
Incidentally, the truest of all indications of the interest with which the
President regards the conservation of the natural resources of this country
lies in the character and attainments of the man whom he has placed
at the head of that Department in order to conserve them—Walter L.
Fisher. (Applause.) You will all of you remember how his thorough
investigation and clear-cut decision of the famous Cunningham claims,
has settled and disposed of, in the interest of the people, one of the most
bitter controversies of our cause. You are also undoubtedly familiar
with the careful investigation which he made last year into the very complicated
and serious problems of conservation which confront our Nation
in Alaska; and with the luminous address with which he reported his
conclusions and pointed out a solution of these questions. Though the
work of his Department in investigating and conserving in the public
interest, the water power sites which remain on our public lands, and our
remaining beds of coal and phosphate, has not attracted so much attention
as his work in these former more controverted matters; yet there
is, I think, a very general and well founded feeling throughout the
country that in all these matters the interests of the people of the United
States are being thoroughly protected by the Secretary of the Interior
in accordance with the most intelligent and thorough views of Conservation.
(Applause.)</p>

<p>I allude to his method of thorough investigation because I think it is
characteristic of the attitude of the President himself toward this whole
subject. In order that progress should be real, it must be based upon
carefully ascertained facts. In dealing with the problems of Conservation,
we are dealing with problems which are new to our Nation. As the
honorable speaker who first addressed you pointed out, we have only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
recently passed from an era of exploitation into an era of Conservation.
We are surrounded by thousands of our fellow countrymen who have
been brought up to honestly believe that the only method of developing
the country is to turn its resources as rapidly as possible over into private
hands. In putting into effect, therefore, the new policy to which the
Nation has now come, there must be care taken lest false steps, or the
injustice which may come from hasty action, may not produce a reaction
which will delay or imperil the reform. As a former District Attorney,
representing the people in the enforcement of the law, I have long had
it impressed upon me how essential it was that no hasty, or harsh, or intolerant
action, taken in the heat and controversy of a jury trial, should
thereafter imperil the entire work and by producing injustice, and a
subsequent reversal in the higher courts, bring some great reform into
disrepute or temporary delay. Patience, thoroughness, and courage,
mark the only pathway towards permanent progress and reform. (Applause.)</p>

<p>Now, the subject which I am going to call to your attention briefly
this morning is one of those few matters where my own Department,
instead of the Department of the Interior, touches upon the problems of
national Conservation. It is also a subject the history of which, I think,
exemplifies clearly the importance of the methods to which I have just
alluded. I wish to point out to you the attitude of the administration as
to the Federal regulation of water power in our navigable rivers.</p>

<p>It is needless to remind such a body as yours of the importance of
that sphere of Conservation. All our other present sources of power—such
as coal, wood, oil, and the like—are limited, and will be eventually
exhausted. Water power alone is permanent. And just as we are coming
to learn more and more the value of that permanence, we are simultaneously,
through the development of electricity, learning to transmit its
energy to greater and greater distances. No other subject occupied more
keenly the attention of the past session of Congress, or was more vigorously
debated upon the floors of that body.</p>

<p>For many years our national policy, or rather lack of national policy,
towards our waterways and our water power, has presented a singular
inconsistency. On the other hand, we have been spending hundreds of
millions of the taxpayers’ money on the improvement of the navigation
of our great inland waterways. On the other, we have been granting
away permits for the construction of dams on these same rivers and
waterways, which will create water power of incalculable and increasing
value; and we have been doing this without exacting <em>for</em> the taxpayers
any return or compensation whatever.</p>

<p>I believe it was not until the administration of President Roosevelt
that any effort was made to obtain for the public any compensation for
the water power which was thus granted away. Mr. Roosevelt demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
in his veto of the James River bill, and in several other messages, that no
permits for dams in navigable rivers should be granted without a reservation
of proper compensation to the public for the grant thus made.
His action was courageous and right. But there were not as yet in the
hands of the public sufficient carefully ascertained facts upon which the
constitutional power of the Federal Government to take such action could
be confidently based. And there was therefore great ground for misapprehension
in the public mind of any action attempting to take such
a position. A bitter controversy at once arose with those advocates of
States’ rights, who contended that the Federal Government had no rights
whatever in connection with water power, that under the Constitution its
powers were limited solely to navigation, and that water power was an
entirely separate and distinct sphere, falling wholly within the jurisdiction
of the several States. Such advocates contended that for the Federal
Government to exact compensation for a water power right, simply
because it was in a position to withhold the permit altogether if it wanted
to, was little better than legalized blackmail; and the progress of the
reform was stubbornly and for a long time successfully contested.</p>

<p>Even as late as 1906, the General Dam Act, passed by Congress and
approved by the President, conveys to the Executive no clear right to
exact compensation for these grants. It has remained for Mr. Taft’s
administration, following the method of patient investigation and research
which I have above mentioned, to collect the facts necessary to
solve the problem, and to show from these facts that the jurisdiction of
the Federal Government over navigation must necessarily include jurisdiction
over water power as an incident of the navigation.</p>

<p>Most of the rivers of this country are long and comparatively shallow.
In order to make them commercially navigable, there has become prevalent
among engineers a method of improvement known as the “slack
water” method or the method of “canalization.” The method consists
in building throughout the length of these rivers, a series of dams and
locks, by which the river is converted into a succession of deep pools,
adequate for commerce of a far more important character than could use
the river in its unimproved condition. In fact, many rivers which are
not capable in their natural state of being used at all commercially, can
by this method be made useful and available for important commerce.</p>

<p>Now, most of the dams thus constructed in a “slack water” improvement,
particularly in the rapid portions of the streams, will create water
power of commercial value. It is also manifest that if the commercial
value of the water power thus created can be realized by the Government
and turned into further river improvement, the improvement of navigation
on our rivers can be greatly expedited, and the expense to the general
taxpayer very much lessened. And, on the contrary, unless this is
done, the complete improvement of the river will be just so much delayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
and postponed. The water power developed is thus shown to be intimately
connected with navigation. It is a by-product of the improvement
which can be turned into further improvement. And from the
standpoint of constitutional law, it makes no difference whether the dam
in question is to be erected by the Federal Government or by a private
corporation. If it is a dam which is to assist the navigation of the river
as well as to create water power, the power of the Government will be
complete. What the Federal Government can constitutionally do itself
it can do through an agent.</p>

<p>The corps of army engineers to whom are referred all proposed bills
in Congress granting permits for dams for water power have been accordingly,
under Mr. Taft’s administration, directed to investigate and
answer specifically four questions in every report. They are directed to
ascertain in regard to every such bill:</p>

<p>First, is the river on which the dam is to be created a navigable stream
subject to being improved, either now or in the future of the country, at
the expense of the general taxpayer?</p>

<p>In the second place, they are asked whether the dam which is sought
to be constructed will form an essential part of any such improvement.</p>

<p>Thirdly, whether the dam will create water power of commercial
value.</p>

<p>Fourthly, whether the value of that water power will tend to increase
with the growth and development of the Nation.</p>

<p>You can see for yourself the pertinence of such questions. Once answered
in the affirmative, there is a case presented upon which the jurisdiction
of the Government’s power can rest.</p>

<p>Trial has now shown that the answers to these questions are nearly
always in the affirmative. And as a result of the information thus obtained
we are in a position now, unlike our position six years ago, where
we can take a step forward, and hold permanently the ground thus
gained.</p>

<p>There is now laid before Congress a sure foundation upon which we
can rest our national right to exact the fair value of these grants. Investigation
has regularly brought out the fact that each one of these dams
is essentially connected with navigation, and that a failure to preserve the
right to regulate them and to exact compensation for the power created
is throwing away a valuable national asset.</p>

<p>The issue has been sharply drawn by President Taft, and his position
clearly stated in his message, submitted on the 24th of last August,
vetoing the bill which proposed to grant authority to build a dam in the
Coosa River. The Coosa River is in Alabama. The bill in question
sought to authorize the Alabama Power Company to build a dam suitable
for the development of navigation in that river, and at the same
time to create water power for the exclusive benefit of the corporation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
It contained no provision permitting the Federal Government to exact
any compensation for the rights of water power thus granted. The
bill was strongly urged by powerful leaders of both houses of Congress.
It was also vigorously opposed by the leaders of the conservation movement
of Congress. But it ultimately passed. The President vetoed
it in a message which asserts in unqualified language the duty of the
Federal Government to reserve to itself the right to exact proper compensation.
(Applause.) The President says on this point:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“I think this is a fatal defect in the bill, and that it is just as improvident
to grant this permit <em>without</em> such a reservation as it would be to throw away any
other asset of the Government. To make such a reservation is not depriving the
States of anything that belongs to them. On the contrary, in the report of the
Secretary of War it is recommended that all compensation for similar privileges
should be applied strictly to the improvement of navigation in the respective
streams—a strictly Federal function. The Federal Government by availing itself
of this right may in time greatly reduce the swollen expenditures for river improvements
which now fall wholly upon the general taxpayer. I deem it highly
important that the nation should adopt a consistent and harmonious policy of
treatment of these water power projects which will preserve for this purpose
their value to the Government whose right it is to grant the permit.”</p>
</div>

<p>There are few subjects of equal importance with the proper improvement
of our great river systems. We are behind many of the nations
of Europe in our appreciation of this importance. The development of
our rivers is not only vitally important for the commerce that they will
thus carry, but even more for the regulative effect which they should
and can have upon the freight rates of the railroads with which they
compete. If Mr. Taft’s position is sustained, it means that all the potential
value of these streams can be turned toward the improvement of
their navigation. As he says, it offers one of the possible solutions for
our swollen river and harbor appropriations. On the other hand, it
also means that the hand of the nation is to be kept on this great national
asset of our water power; and that this great subject of water power
regulation will be handled comprehensively, consistently, and with due
regard for the wants of the Nation as a whole.</p>

<p>If, however, the view of the opponents of the President prevails, it
means that this necessary improvement of our rivers will be greatly
postponed, and that all the expense of such improvement will have to
be borne by the general taxpayers of the Nation. And it further means
that the closely related subject of our water powers on these navigable
rivers, instead of being treated nationally and broadly, will be subject
to the piecemeal policies of forty-eight different States. Seldom is there
presented an opportunity to apply the principles of conservation simultaneously
to two such important subjects as river transportation and
water power regulation. (Applause.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—I am sure we all appreciate the address that has
just been delivered by our distinguished representative of the President.
It has left upon our minds the significance of the importance of
protecting those natural resources that are permanent and which should
not be given away to private individuals, or corporations.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Announcements</span></h3>
<p>We will now hear some announcements.</p>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Thomas R. Shipp</span> (Executive Secretary)—The section of which
Dr. Wiley is chairman, the section on “Food”, will meet this afternoon
at four instead of tomorrow morning. The meeting will be held in the
Palm Room, Claypool Hotel, and will be open to the public. The fact
that Dr. Wiley is at the head of this section and will preside and speak
will make it of great interest to delegates. In addition to Dr. Wiley,
there are other gentlemen of national reputation on this question who
will speak. An invitation is extended to all delegates to attend this
meeting this afternoon at 4:00 o’clock.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—If there are no further announcements we will
adjourn until this afternoon at 2:00 o’clock.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “What the States are Doing”</span></h3>
<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The first thing on this afternoon’s program is a
report from Dr. George E. Condra on “What the States are Doing.” He
is President of the National Association of Conservation Commissioners.
We are very much interested to know how far the spirit of Conservation
is being taken up and applied in the different States. We
will now hear Dr. Condra.</p>


<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Condra</span>—Mr. President and Delegates: This report, prepared
at the request of the Executive Committee of the Congress, is based on
data received from several Governors, and the conservation organizations
of various States. It can not be given in detail, for that would require
too much of your time. Neither do we deem it advisable to treat the
subject State by State, for it would call for needless repetition. Consequently
the data are reviewed subject by subject corresponding to the
leading departments of Conservation, and the States are mentioned
only in connection with the progress they have attained in each department.
It is assumed that: 1. You are in full sympathy with State
Conservation and its co-operation with Federal agencies. 2. You do not
expect to hear overdrawn statements. 3. You wish a review of such
conservation facts as are really worth while in development. 4. You
know how natural resources control industrial development. 5. You
agree that the leading resources in the United States are mineral fuels,
iron, water, soil, plant and animal life, the varying importance in the
distribution of which determines to a considerable extent the locations
of industrial and commercial centers, and that these resources are not
distributed according to state lines, but that development is influenced
to some extent by State laws.</p>


<p class="center">COAL.</p>

<p>The importance of coal in our country is much greater than most
people suppose. It is well distributed. The amount of power derived
from it is many times that of all our man power working every hour
of the day. The annual production of our coal leads that of Great
Britain by a wide margin. The ranking States in output are Pennsylvania,
West Virginia, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Alabama, Colorado,
Iowa, Wyoming, Tennessee and Maryland. Wyoming is thought
to contain even larger natural stores of coal than Pennsylvania. Mr.
Edward W. Parker, head of the coal division of the United States Geological
Survey, reports over two trillion tons of unmined coal west of
the 100th meridian, lying principally in the Great Plains and Rocky
Mountain provinces, and in smaller districts farther west.</p>

VICE-PRESIDENT, FIFTH NATIONAL CONSERVATION CONGRESS<br>
</p>

<p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
<p>It is evident that there is much more coal for future consumption
than most conservationists have claimed. This is a pleasing fact, for it
indicates that industry should not be seriously hampered by lack of this
source of power for many years to come. The argument that there is
enough coal and to spare is used, however, to further selfish ends. It
causes bad management of coal lands at many places. Notwithstanding
the fact that the United States is so favorably endowed with coal it
is coming to be known that some of the better bituminous and anthracite
grades most favorably located are doomed to early exhaustion. The
rapid increase in the use of these is causing some of the eastern States
to show deep interest in conservation.</p>

<p>During the year the conservation of coal was directed mainly towards
larger recovery from the mines, to the study and prevention of mine
accidents, especially those caused by explosions, to improving the methods
of use whereby more power is derived, and to the saving of by-products
in coke making. The National Bureau of Mines lead in most
of these investigations. Several States, mostly in the eastern province,
studied the same problems, as for example, Pennsylvania, West Virginia,
Tennessee, Virginia and Alabama. Illinois was equally active in
the interior province. Practically all coal mines are now inspected by
delegated authority.</p>

<p>The bee-hive coke oven produced relatively less coke during the year
than the by-product oven in which is recovered coal tar and other useful
products of considerable value. Investigations definitely proved that
the most economic way to use certain soft coals is in the manufacture
of producer gas. The culm heaps in the Scranton and Wilkesbarre
districts were drawn upon more than formerly for the production of the
smaller sizes of washed coal. This is an important utilization of what
formerly was waste.</p>

<p>It would seem that every one in this Congress should be deeply interested
in the conservation of coal whether his State produces it or not,
for the permanence of this resource has a power relation, one that affects
the industrial and social development of the whole country.</p>


<p class="center">PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS.</p>

<p>These are uncertain resources as to their occurrence and permanence
of development. The amount of production, however, is very large,
coming from several States, and having increased from about 63,000,000
barrels in 1900 to over 200,000,000 barrels in 1911. New pools were
developed in each province, though the annual production fell off at
places. The largest developments were in California and Oklahoma,
yet Illinois, West Virginia, Ohio, Texas, Pennsylvania, Louisiana
and Indiana were important producers, as they have been for several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
years. No new conservation movements were inaugurated except
that California took more definite steps to prevent waste at the
wells. Adequate tankage, together with a high degree of attainment
in refining, are the two leading factors in the conservation of petroleum.
This industry is a splendid example of conservation for
special interests, yet the public is supplied with many useful commodities,
such as kerosene, gasoline, waxes, paraffine, oils, etc. Kerosene has
a close commercial relation to the gas engine and the automobile industry.
The price of gasoline, for reasons not fully understood by the
speaker, made a marked advance. Just how this may affect the future
building of gas engines is not known.</p>

<p>The production of natural gas is even more erratic than petroleum.
It is readily used in the manufacture of brick, tile, glass and cement.
A lack of permanence gives to the gas-using industries a migratory
character, a movement to and from gas regions. For several years such
plants have operated up to their full market capacity in Kansas and
Oklahoma. The financial depressions of 1907 and of the past year
checked some of factory building in and near the gas regions. For
about two years certain companies have been diligent in selling equipment
for making gasoline from natural gas.</p>

<p>The conservation movement is partly responsible for the decrease in
waste of natural gas. Formerly the unused wells of Oklahoma and
Louisiana, especially, were allowed to cast their millions of feet of fuel
into the air without even a remonstrance from the States. Flambeaux
burned night and day in the streets of small towns and many persons
between Indiana and Texas were then heard to say that gas is cheaper
than matches. The States stand indicted. This wrong to nature and to
present and future industry cannot be repaired. The deed is done, and
our only hope is that we may escape without having to suffer for such
an offense.</p>


<p class="center">IRON ORE.</p>

<p>This is the basis of iron and steel manufacture. It supplies the
materials used in harnessing the power of fuel and water and has importance
in mining, transportation, smelting and milling. The industries
connected with iron and steel making in the United States are
conducted in a much larger way than in Great Britain and Germany
next in rank. The increasing use of steel by railroads, in highway construction,
ship-building, the making of engines and farm machinery, and
for large building is causing many persons to wonder how long this
progress can continue unhampered. Is there no limit to our high
grade ore and to the development of the gigantic enterprises dependent
upon coal, iron and steel? What appears to be the correct answer to
this question has been made by good authority. It is that the supply of
high grade ore, like that now used, is not permanent—that it will not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
last many years. If this is true, the time will be when it will become
necessary to mine less desirable ore, grading lower and lower as production
continues. This, without doubt, will have an unfavorable effect
upon our whole industrial organization.</p>

<p>The history of iron in the United States is most interesting. It
shows that one by one many of the small districts were abandoned for
the richer fields of the Lake Superior region, the Birmingham and
Guernsey districts. The States that lost out in this change now realize
that production may again return to their borders when the richer and
larger deposits are exhausted. In consequence of this several States are
beginning investigations looking to the future utilizing of low grade
ores. At the smelters more than usual thought is given to the quality
of output, making it more durable or otherwise better suited to the use
for which it is intended. Experiments are under way for the purpose
of testing out hydro-electric smelting in parts of California and other
western States where the ore is distant from coal.</p>

<p>Much of the iron and steel conservation is directed by corporate
interests in whom the ownership of ore and the development based
thereon are definitely established.</p>


<p class="center">WATER RESOURCES.</p>

<p>Dr. W. J. McGee, whose death we mourn, once said that “water is
the prime necessity of life.” He also discussed its importance for
drinking, in navigation, for power, and in the production from the soil
of such materials as food and clothing.</p>

<p>The drinking water of the country and small towns is obtained
principally from underground through wells and springs. A few
States are trying to improve their domestic water supply by making
sanitary surveys, noting the relation of the wells to drainage from lots,
privies and other dangerous sources. Typhoid epidemics, due to sewage
entering the water system, occurred in several towns. More than usual
activity was manifest in making careful studies of streams in their
relation to floods, drainage, power, sewage, water supplies and navigation.
The Lakes and Rivers Commission of Illinois has gathered and
published more data than other States in this line. The subject, “Navigation
of Inland Waterways,” with special reference to the Mississippi
and its “Lakes to the Gulf Route,” received new impetus principally
because of its relation to the Panama Route. The Gulf States are now
supported by Illinois especially in a campaign for larger attainments
in this development.</p>

<p>Irrigation had a good year, especially so in the Rocky Mountain and
Great Plains regions. The irrigation development is an important contributor
to the larger industrial life of the whole country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span></p>


<p class="center">LAND AND SOIL.</p>

<p>The United States has vast areas of land of many kinds. The soil
of this land is our greatest physical resource. Its fertility feeds the
crops and is therefore of fundamental importance in agriculture and
industrial development based thereon. Nevertheless, it is true that
many disregard this great fact in their farm management. They conserve
their own selfish interests and not the state. Just how to develop
the State’s view point in land management is not known. The southern
States, in co-operation with the United States Department of Agriculture,
are making progress in the solution of this problem. In many
places there, the farmers are showing rapid improvement in crop rotation
and methods of cultivation.</p>

<p>In Texas and Florida, much of the wet alluvial land is being improved
by drainage. The Levee and Drainage Board of Texas surveyed
over 300,000 acres last year and constructed 100 miles of levees. Land
valued at twenty dollars an acre became worth seventy-five dollars to
one hundred dollars at a cost of thirty dollars per acre. Deep floods
of the Mississippi River did great damage in Louisiana, Mississippi,
Arkansas and Kentucky, causing the Delta region to put forth a plea for
National aid in draining the wet lands of the South. It does seem that
their plea for support should not go unheeded when such a vast, fertile
area lies unreclaimed.</p>

<p>Nearly every State is studying soil erosion, the tenant system and
land taxation. Dr. E. N. Lowe, State Geologist of Mississippi, reports
that his survey endeavored to secure the enactment of a law that would
tend to check the great losses in the northern part of the State caused
by soil erosion. The bill was opposed by a prominent senator on the
ground that it would interfere with the personal rights of land owners.
The bill did not pass, but Dr. Lowe is to conduct a campaign of education
before the next Legislature is convened. The difference in viewpoint
here shown, is the difference between the meaning of “legal”
and “right.” Does any one have the right to ruin the land?</p>

<p>Co-operative soil surveys were carried on during the year in the
various States with complete success. Every State now sees the need
of reliable study and mapping of its soils, to serve as a basis for farm
management, taxation, and real estate. At a recent meeting of the
National Tax Association, held in Des Moines, Iowa, the relation of
land surveys and taxation was discussed with considerable detail. It
was the conclusion that land value maps should be prepared by soil
surveys to serve as a physical basis of taxation.</p>


<p class="center">FOREST RESOURCES.</p>

<p>Though originally endowed with vast areas of forest on public
domain, some having great value, our Federal Government was slow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
to develop effective measures for its protection, utilization and future
growth. One generation stripped the forest from the agricultural lands
of the central west; and their posterity turned the trick with interest
in the west. No wonder many persons took advantage of such an occasion
as was presented in the Rocky Mountain and Pacific regions to
help themselves where the public treasury was free for the asking, not
having been carefully surveyed and evaluated. The large timber owners
are not alone to blame for this history, which in considerable part
is not what it might have been. It is time, then, to close the chapter
and to turn our attention to present day events in so far as they are
related to forest conservation. Now the State foresters and Federal
forces closely co-operate with the large lumber producers along several
lines. The Weeks Law, recently enacted, furthers co-operative effort
in the prevention of forest fires. One of the first States to take advantage
of this law was Wisconsin. Then came applications from New
Hampshire, Montana and most other forest States. New York appears
to lead in perfecting State patrol. Most States in the Appalachian
province have perfected their patrol systems. Oregon appears to lead
in the Pacific region.</p>

<p>Colorado of the Rocky Mountain province is fighting the Forestry
Commission, the Conservation Commission and Federal agencies, under
the guise of State Rights. Here the National Government has large
reserves and is meeting the expense of fire protection. Certain State
men are diligently spreading the doctrine of State Rights, claiming
that the Federal Government should cede its domain to the State.
Such a sentiment is echoed, but not so forcefully, in a few other western
States. The opponents of this doctrine claim that the States do not
have the means to patrol the forest, and that the State Rights people are
making the campaign for selfish reasons—to secure ownership of the
forest.</p>

<p>During the year, many cities and States added to the area of their
parks and forest reserves. The Maryland Legislature voted $50,000
for this purpose. The Appalachian bill passed the last Congress, providing
funds for use in establishing reserves in the Appalachian
province. A start in this development has been made at several places.
It is reported, however, that land speculators are interfering with the
project by securing options on land that is wanted for the reserves.</p>

<p>The work in general tree planting and forestation progressed about
as usual. Promoters handle eucalyptus propositions in California with
varying degrees of success. Many States, especially in the middle west,
are planting catalpa for the production of posts. One of the largest
problems in several States, as in Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin and
Michigan, is that of utilizing the cut-over land. Some of this is suitable
for farming, but much of it is classed as forest land. The problem<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
then is one of reforestation, which cannot be done economically on most
of the land because of high tax. The tax problem is closely related
to and by many thought to be the controlling feature in the reforestation
of land in private ownership. The Wisconsin and the Oregon
Conservation Commissions are studying the problem. Louisiana has
passed laws intended to promote timber planting on large holdings.</p>

<p>A few States published helpful literature on economic species of
trees suitable for forestation, shade and decorative purposes. A little
volume by the New Jersey Forest Commission, title “Planting and
Care of Shade Trees,” is a model that other States may well follow.</p>

<p>Following in line with the recommendations of this Congress, and in
harmony with the policies of state foresters and the Federal Bureau,
considerable progress was made during the year in forest surveys and
forest studies. Fully half of the States are doing this work under the
direction of their geological surveys, forest bureaus, or Conservation
Commissions. Maryland and Rhode Island have completed such
surveys.</p>

<p>Several large lumber producers report improvements in the way of
saving practically all of the timber. When one wants to cite an example
of extreme waste in lumbering, he usually refers to the Pacific region,
perhaps not realizing that the method of utilization may be determined
by commercial limitations. Be that as it may, it is pleasing to know
that some companies in the West, as for example, the Smith Lumber &amp;
Manufacturing Company, are installing by-product plants. The company
above named is building a fiber plant to utilize the waste mill
products by the sulphate process, and to extract the turpentine from
the red fir.</p>


<p class="center">VITAL RESOURCES.</p>

<p>More than usual progress has been made in recent years in learning
that living things, whether forest, forage, cereal crops, game, fish, farm
animals or man, are natural resources subject to development.</p>

<p>Perhaps the greatest result of the Conservation movement is found
in its helpfulness in improving the life and lot of people. Such a stimulus
is needed, for it certainly is time society should conserve its men
and women not only in working efficiency but in fitness to be fathers
and mothers as well.</p>

<p>Most States have departments to promote good seed, fish and game
resources, and the breed and health of animals. Some of the publications
issued by these departments are most attractive and valuable as,
for example, the reports on birds by the North Caroline Geologist-Natural
History Survey.</p>

<p>More than usual State activity is now put forth in improving the
stock, health, life and working efficiency of people. To further this end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
there is inspection of water, milk, food, drugs, and factories. Several
States are making preliminary sanitary surveys; others conduct investigations
under the head of “conservation of people.” It has been learned
that the public health can be markedly improved by observing a few
simple safeguards that prevent sickness and disease. This calls for
education, and perhaps for organized inspection of both the home and
the school. State medical colleges begin to realize their duty in preventive
medicine, and in some cases show a willingness to co-operate
with health organizations in extension work in the conservation of public
health. A number of the Southern States have taken important
steps to rid their sections of typhoid, tuberculosis and the hook worm
disease. Mississippi reports marked progress in this line. The Louisiana
Health Train is known to all. The exhibits at this Congress indicate
the great progress attained by Dr. Hurty and others in their fields. In
closing the discussion in this department it should be noted that practically
all parts of the country show a deep interest in the work of
Dr. Wiley and the fight he has made for pure food. It is further evident
that there is a strong demand for a Federal health department to work
in co-operation with the state departments.</p>


<p class="center">CONSERVATION ORGANIZATION.</p>

<p>Several State departments are related to Conservation work, as for
example, the Geological Survey, Soil Survey, Natural History Survey,
Forest Commission, Public Service Commission, Pure Food Department,
Health Department, and Experiment Stations. So, since most
of these have been in existence for several years, we should know that
conservation work is not a new thing. The various forces were united
into a definite movement, however, in 1908, following the Governors’
conference at Washington. Immediately after the adjournment of that
meeting the Governors appointed State conservation commissions to
serve their respective States. Unfortunately, many commissioners were
selected mainly because of their political affiliations. In some cases the
selections were made wholly on the basis of ability to serve. Such Commissioners
were chosen from among public spirited citizens, and the
State and university departments closely connected with industrial
development.</p>

<p>Practically all commissioners chosen because of political affiliation
did very little work. Most of them were not reappointed after changes
in State administrations. The non-political commissions did better
work as a rule, and soon received financial support and statutory authority
from the State for a wider range of activity. The commissioners
with this authority are now appointed by the Governor, or they become
commissioners by virtue of their connection with certain university<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
and State departments named in the State laws. The tendency is to
make the commissions entirely non-political and to give them full charge
of certain natural resource surveys and the State supervision of development,
at least to some extent. A resolution passed by the Trans-Mississippi
Commercial Congress of this year is of interest in this connection.
It reads thus: “We favor the selection of Conservation Commissioners
from among those who are actively engaged in State surveys, in the
investigation of conservation problems, or in the development of public
welfare.” It further urges that the work of such commissioners be
done along non-political lines and in co-operation with Federal Conservation
efforts. Most States have conservation commissions.</p>

<p>The best organized work is in New York, Rhode Island, Oregon,
Nebraska, Wisconsin, Kansas, Utah, West Virginia and New Mexico.
The New York Commission has three commissioners, a secretary, assistant
secretary, deputy commissioners and several engineers, all well paid.
The Commission has full authority to investigate and supervise the
development of water, forest, fish and game resources. Rhode Island
stands next to New York in organization, duties, and results attained.
Its commission has full charge of the natural history survey, supervises
the development of natural resources, and conducts an educational campaign.
Nebraska’s commission is non-political, composed principally of
heads of departments in the University, who also direct the various
State surveys. The duties of the commission are largely in supervision
and education. A Conservation Survey unites the efforts of the University
and State departments in systematic surveys of the water, soil
and forest and in making careful field studies of the leading economic
problems. Nebraska holds a Conservation Congress each year with a
large attendance. This Congress has great value in unifying State
development. It is under the guidance of the Commission, Conservation
Survey and public spirited citizens and is an open forum for the discussion
of development problems. The duties of other State Commissions
are similar to those of the States above described. Utah is directing
its effort mainly in the line of making non-political maps.</p>

<p>The Conservation Commissioners together with other persons directing
State development have an organization called the National Association
of Conservation Commissioners. It meets each year as a department
of this Congress. The object of the association is co-operation, in
which each State is able to learn of the progress attained in other
States.</p>

<p>That the conservation activities in the various States are benefited
by the different sessions of the National Conservation Congress is very
evident. The influence also of the National Conservation Association is
helpful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>In concluding this division of my report, I wish to emphasize the
facts that the State conservation commission is coming into a broad
field of work, that it must stand for the best interests of the State as
a whole, that an important part of its activity is to unite the efforts of
departments now existing in a co-operative work that has practical value
to the State. Such commission must be composed of broad-minded men,
preferably those who have a thorough acquaintance with the departments
represented. The commissioners should be free from political
entanglements, and refrain from using their position for selfish ends.
They should stand for the greatest good of their States first, last and
all the time.</p>

<p>Does your State have a commission of this kind?</p>


<p class="center">SURVEY BASIS OF DEVELOPMENT.</p>

<p>The survey idea is now popular. In fact it may be abused in some
cases, especially where the work is done with a lack of scientific spirit
and undue rapidity. Such effort has no place in the conservation survey
which seeks to determine useful facts, those really worth while in
development.</p>

<p>In harmony with the spirit of the year which calls for the fundamentals,
we have the following resolution by the Trans-Mississippi Congress,
passed in its last session:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“Recognizing the natural resources as the physical basis of development, we
urge the States of the Trans-Mississippi region to make surveys of their leading
resources under competent direction, and to publish reliable reports upon the
same. We favor such reorganization of the State conservation commissions as
will qualify them to make inventories of natural resources, to study industrial
problems, and promote the proper development of the respective States.”</p>
</div>

<p>This demands that Conservation be placed on a survey basis. Just
that thing is the order in many States under the leadership of conservation
activity and through the co-operation of State and Federal agencies.
During the past year, progress was made in co-operating the work
of the different surveys, making them of greater value to the people
and State. It is now understood and agreed that the following lines of
information should be determined and made available for use in the
development of each State as soon as possible consistent with good work
and reliable results and in about the order herein named. The points
considered in the complete survey are:</p>

<p>A. Topography. By topography is meant the surface features of
the land. Topographic maps have many uses in development. Maryland,
New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, and a few other
States are now mapped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>B. Structure. By this we mean the underground make-up of a
region, the kind and arrangement of the materials of the land. Structure
is directly related to mineral resources, topography, water supply,
and soils.</p>

<p>C. Surface Water and Drainage. This refers to the amount of run-off,
to such as streams, lakes, marshes, and has importance in irrigation,
navigation, fish culture, city water supplies, etc. Illinois is leading in
this survey.</p>

<p>D. Ground Water. This is water in the land. It is the source of
crop water and the largest source for domestic and town supplies. The
amount of water held by the soil is even more important than the quantity
of rainfall. The depth to the water table, and the quantity, and
quality of well water are of great importance in agricultural regions.</p>

<p>E. Climate. The elements—temperature, sunshine, wind, humidity,
and rainfall—are recognized as having importance and should be
known for every part of our country. The latest movement is for
facts in local climate, even that of the farm or certain parts of it, and
of the soil.</p>

<p>F. Soils. The relation of soil to industry is generally known. The
soil survey classifies and describes the soils as to origin and properties,
and maps them accurately so that the farmer may know definitely the
kinds and their distribution on his farm. Farm management demands
intelligent comprehension of soil characteristics.</p>

<p>G. Native Life. The native plants and animals of a country represent
the natural selection of the fittest for the conditions encountered.
The life of a region reflects the topography, soil, and climate under
which it lives. In new territory the native plant life reveals to the
keen student much concerning the soil and climatic conditions. In
older communities undisturbed patches of vegetation tell the same story.
By studying such life the qualities needed in cultivated crops may be
fairly well determined and the losses incident to haphazard experimenting
avoided. Native life then needs to be considered in a rural survey
because: (1) It gives a summary history of soil and climatic influences;
(2) it may lead to economic production of certain native types of
plants and animals; (3) it presents concretely the problem of utilization
of waste lands; (4) it will give emphasis to the need of utilizing our
lakes and streams as a source of food supply.</p>

<p>H. Social and Industrial Conditions. If a move into new territory
is contemplated, the questions of vital interest are not only of the natural
and industrial conditions but also in regard to social conditions. By
this is meant the classes of people as to race and culture, and the opportunities
offered for advance in social and intellectual lines. These characteristics
of people are closely associated with their occupations. The
pursuits of the people are largely dominated by the physical basis of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
industry. Hence the social survey must recognize this influence if it is
to correctly interpret conditions as they exist. Data of most vital
interest in the social rural survey pertain to the following lines:
(a) History of settlement. (b) Condition of agriculture. (c) Education.
(d) Religion. (e) Recreation. (f) Sanitation. The industrial
conditions of a region are practically determined by its physical features.
The development is further related to the biological and social life.
Hence the industrial survey must be based on these fundamentals if it
is to be comprehensive.</p>

<p>In closing this review of the fundamentals in surveys it should be
understood that: 1. The physical and biological surveys should come
first, since they are necessary for accurate work in other investigations.
2. The special surveys of industries, rural and urban life should be made
from the common basis of physical and biological conditions and extended
into their respective fields.</p>

<p>It should be recognized that the broad controls affecting industry
are structure, topography, drainage, climate, soils and native life, but
that they do not have equal importance in any and every locality. Any
one of them may be the controlling feature with the rest of minor importance.</p>

<p>It is not a pleasing fact to know that most States have not yet accurately
mapped their lands, waters and forests. The departments responsible
for this work should receive adequate financial support and the
people in turn should demand results.</p>

<p>What progress has your State made in these lines?</p>


<p class="center">RELATION OF EDUCATION TO CONSERVATION.</p>

<p>The State universities of the Middle West especially are meeting
their obligation to the people by training students for real work—for
efficient service. Such institutions, by their instruction, surveys and
extension departments further the development of practically every
line of industrial activity in the State. From these centers are directed
geological, soil, water, sanitary, social, farm management and other
surveys. Consequently the professors and advanced students get a good
work-out and the citizens are caused to look to the institution for assistance
in practically every development problem that arises. The State
universities that are giving the largest service in this line appear to be
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Cornell Agricultural College, Illinois, and Nebraska.
It is my great privilege to be connected with one of these.</p>

<p>Unmistakably, the present tendency is to associate the public service
State departments and conservation activities more with higher
education, taking them from the field of politics. This noticeable feature
in the rearrangement of conservation activities of the past year is
worthy of consideration by all States.</p>

<p>The different lines of business are conserved in many ways. This
applies to practical developments in improving the process involved in
handling commodities all the way from manufacture to sale; to trade,
in the direction of economy in buying, transportation and sales; to
farming in improving methods of cultivation, the better care of stock,
and in less buying on time; to more economic use of school and church
buildings; to the building and maintenance of good roads and clean
streets, and to the improvement of public service generally. So there
is room for practical conservation in many lines. It prevents waste,
increases efficiency, and thereby decreases the cost of commodities. A
very general movement for good business is the feature of the year. It
is promoting real business by demanding that it be done on the square
and free from fraud. This is working a public good.</p>

<p>At another time, I will discuss the subject, “Land Frauds or
Get-Rich-Quick Schemes,” with special reference to their effect upon real
business.</p>


<p class="center">CONCLUSIONS.</p>

<p>As a summary conclusion, you will permit me to enumerate the things
that stand out in the progress of the year.</p>

<p>1. The prominence of Conservation on many State and National
programs.</p>

<p>2. The tendency to place State development on a survey and fact
basis.</p>

<p>3. Development of co-operation between State and Federal agencies.</p>

<p>4. Demand by the public for reliable land classifications, soil, sanitary
and agricultural surveys.</p>

<p>5. Interest in soil fertility as a basis for agricultural development.</p>

<p>6. The affiliation of Conservation organizations with educational
departments and removal from politics.</p>

<p>7. Discussion of Lakes-to-the-Gulf Route and success attained in
presenting the cause of drainage in the Mississippi delta region.</p>

<p>8. Modernizing of State universities, making them of greater value
to the State.</p>

<p>9. The determined demand for vocational training in the public
schools.</p>

<p>10. A demand for less extravagance in public service.</p>

<p>11. Taxation of cut-over lands.</p>

<p>12. Perfection of forest control.</p>

<p>13. The very general recognition that people are the most important
natural resource subject to development.</p>

<p>14. Increased regard for sanitation throughout the country.</p>

<p>15. Massachusetts minimum wage law for women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>16. A determined and widespread movement on the part of social
workers to eliminate the social evil.</p>

<p>17. Widespread movement against fraud and the assistance given
to the movement by the Postoffice and National Reclamation departments.</p>

<p>18. More than usual discussion of co-operative enterprises and
methods of distribution.</p>

<p>19. Rapid progress in the building and maintenance of good roads.</p>

<p>20. A growing tendency for the citizens in every part of the country
to outgrow provincialism; to come into respect and appreciation for
the people and institutions of every State; to recognize the fact that
the home State is but a part of the Union and larger world in which
people live not to themselves alone but in helpful relationship with all
others.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—This was a very interesting address, which we
allowed to extend beyond the time, because it is a summary of Conservation
work during the past year in all the States. Heretofore, we have
had a report from a representative of each State, but it was thought
advisable this year to have these reports condensed into one paper, a
work which Dr. Condra has done most admirably.</p>

<p>The next address, which is of the greatest interest, is on the subject
of “Human Life, Our Greatest Resource,” and the name of the gentleman
who is to deliver it will be a sufficient guaranty that it will be
replete with interest, and will be useful to every one of us who listens.
I now introduce Dr. William A. Evans, of Chicago.</p>


<p>(Dr. Evans failed to return his manuscript for insertion in the Proceedings.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—We must hasten on, for we have some other addresses
that will be very interesting to the children. There are a great
many present that have come no doubt to see the wild life pictures. So
we shall have to hasten in order to reach them.</p>

<p>Dr. Bessey, who was to have been next on our program, will be here
at 3:30 o’clock.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Conservation Redifined”</span></h3>
<p>We shall now call on Mr. E. T. Allen, of Portland, Oregon, whose
subject is “Conservation Redefined.”</p>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Allen</span>—On a hot afternoon, a bare-footed boy, on his way home
from school, in western Washington, eager as any school boy for the
swimming hole, or whatever waiting attraction had kept his eye on the
clock since about 2:00 o’clock, stopped, hesitated, then clambered down
a steep, brushy slope to the stream at its foot, filled his hat with water,
climbed up the hill again laboriously so as not to spill his burden, and
put it on a camp-fire some voting citizen had left burning by the roadside.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
It still smoked, so he went back twice, three times. About then,
the man who told me this story came along and asked the boy why he
made it his business to put out that fire.</p>

<p>“Why, it told in a little book I got at school,” was the reply, “why
every one should try to stop forest fires. It told what grown-up people
can do by being careful and passing laws and such, but it said a boy
may do as much as anybody by putting out some little fire with water
or dirt before it gets big.”</p>

<p>Now, the action of that school boy, and of the teacher who handed
him the booklet, and of the State authorities who instructed her to do
so, and of the man who wrote the booklet and enlisted the State’s co-operation
in its distribution to a hundred thousand children, and of the
timber owners through whose protective association that man was hired
and the cost of printing and distributing that booklet was paid, was
Conservation. It was forest Conservation, definitely conceived, definitely
executed, and with an exceedingly definite result.</p>

<p>About a month ago I was talking to an extremely intelligent man, a
scientific man whose life is devoted to bettering humanity. He said,
“Allen, do you believe in Conservation?”</p>

<p>Rather astonished, I replied, “It’s my trade, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean forest protection, like putting out fires and
making trees grow, but forest Conservation—Pinchotism, tying up everything
for future generations.”</p>

<p>Now that man’s conception was the result of Conservation activity,
certainly. Without our agitation there would have been no counter
agitation. No doubt he has read of these congresses every fall and of
countless other forms of our work. But, apparently, only one interpretation,
and that a mistaken one, had ever reached him in a form definite
enough to make an impression. How else can you account for getting
effort and sacrifice from the irresponsible barefoot school boy, but no
realization by a citizen of the highest type that Conservation wants his
help in some way that he can give it?</p>

<p>To what extent these remarks apply to your work along other Conservation
lines, I am not competent to say. In forestry, there has been,
I will not say too much debate, but certainly too little other use of our
Conservation machinery in presenting clear-cut principles of forest
economics in the specific local forms and with the specific local needs
that are necessary to engage and direct accomplishment. This is true
of what we do at these meetings and more true of what we do when we
go home.</p>

<p>What our forests need most is more patrolmen, more trails and
telephones for them to use, more funds and organization to marshal
fire-fighting crews when required, better fire laws and courts that will
enforce them, public appreciation that forest fire departments are as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
necessary as city fire departments, more consideration for life and property
by the fool that is careless with match and spark, realization by
more lumbermen that it pays in more ways than one to do their part,
State officials who will handle State lands intelligently, tax laws that
will permit good private management, consumers who will take closely-utilized
products, and a few other things that demand specific study and
specific action. Very few will follow automatically after any amount of
agitation under the general term of forest Conservation. Do you suppose
this would have sent the boy down the hill after water? No more
will it write a good forest code and drive it through the devious channels
of legislation. No more will it organize a hundred busy lumbermen
and install a trained co-operative patrol. No more will it supply
the necessary systematic campaigning to teach the people of your State
and mine in just what ways their homes and pocketbooks are touched by
every injury to forests or forest industry and exactly what they, as
individuals, must do to prevent such injury.</p>

<p>Without decrying their sentimental aspects, these are business problems.
They call for all the exact facts, all the systematic planning, all
the decisive action, all the appeal to human motives, selfish and otherwise,
that are essential to any business. We have a commodity to offer.
By whatever name we call it, fire prevention, reforestation, or more
vague yet, forest Conservation, we are really offering prosperity insurance.
It must be paid for by the community in currency of individual
and collective effort, by individual care with the forest and by public
policies enforced at public expense. To make the community pay for
this commodity requires the same methods that make it buy life insurance;
the same devising of a sound, attractive policy that the buyer can
see and understand, the same skilful advertising, the same personal persuasion
by its agents. I believe that if this were a congress of life
insurance agents they would be talking mostly of just these things, particularly
of improved methods to close with procrastinating “prospects,”
with a view to putting these methods into the most definite kind of practice
the day after they got home. We do not need argument on the
merit of Conservation any more than they would on the merit of life
insurance. We are converted, or we would not be here. But we need
a whole lot of instruction in salesmanship, and I believe we fail to make
this the feature of these congresses that it might be.</p>

<p>Let us look ahead, we agents of prosperity insurance, to see what
is to be done after <em>we</em> get home.</p>

<p>The Government needs little but our moral support. The Federal
Forest Service is our highest authority in technique, the national forests
are our most conspicuous examples of practice. But the task of the
Forest Service is stupendous, not only in protecting these vast forest
areas and the lives within them, but also in replanting denuded areas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
and managing great timber sales, so new growth will follow. Congress
does not appropriate anything like enough for this work. The forest
rangers out West are working for you and me, not for Congress. We
want more of them, and better facilities for their work, and it is up to
us to say so at the right time, to the right men, and so emphatically
that there will be no misunderstanding. Petty politics and “retrenchment”
would not be practiced so much more vigorously when dealing
with the lives and resources of the people than when dealing with the
“pork barrel” if we Conservationists were half as free with telegrams
as we are with resolutions. Yes, this means you. So long as you stand
for having the appropriations for preserving the Nation’s forests from
three to twenty times less per acre than the lumberman is spending on
his contiguous holdings, or for any congressional attack upon the integrity
of the national forest system, your Conservation preachments are
going to the wrong address or are not properly spelled in words that
look like votes.</p>

<p>There is even greater need of definitions that apply to the situation
of our States. Many have done nothing. Others have ill-balanced laws
passed by some one agency without due consideration of the needs of
others or of the greater need of bringing all into harmonious co-operation.
In few is there a far-seeing comprehensive policy financed and executed.
Here, of all places, forest Conservation must narrow itself to specific
issues. Scattered ideas do not pass good laws or prevent the passage of
bad ones. Propaganda work must be as forcible and carefully directed
as blows with an ax, to cut out one by one the local foundation of every
obstacle. In presenting our remedy we must prove our knowledge of the
principles and technical frame-work which will insure freedom from
politics, just distribution of cost, effective organization, strict and enforceable
fire laws, systems of patrol and fire-fighting, facilities for educating
lumber men and public management of State-owned lands, fair
taxation, and, above all, co-operation with and stimulation of endeavor
by private owners. Without such knowledge, and skilful publicity and
campaigning, your very success in general agitation may result in legislation
worse than none.</p>

<p>All this involves considerable knowledge of the problems of the private
owner. After all, he controls most of our forest area. His use of it, our
use of it, and the effect of our relations on our joint use of it, largely
determine our forest destinies. And there is entirely too much forgetting
that forests are useless unless used; that not forests, but forest industry,
is what we really seek to perpetuate. Except from their protection of
stream-flow and game, the community has little to gain from forest preservation
unless it also preserves, on a profitable and permanent footing,
the industry that makes forests usable and worth preserving, that employs
labor, affords market for crops and services, pays taxes, and manufacturers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>and distribute an indispensable commodity. Forest wealth is community
wealth, but not without forest industry to coin it.</p>

<p class="center fs80">OF ATLANTA, GA.,<br>
CHAIRMAN EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE, FOURTH NATIONAL CONSERVATION CONGRESS
</p>

<p>The lumberman as a class, because he is honest and useful as a class,
should be accorded the same encouragement as a captain of desirable
industry that is accorded the leader in agriculture or irrigation who develops
possibilities of utilizing our resources and supplying our needs.
And as a class, because whatever may be true of the past he now sees
his livelihood dependent upon forest preservation, he is a stauncher
supporter of forest reform than any other class. He will utilize the
present crop closely, and grow a new one, whenever these are business
possibilities. The most efficient and liberally supported fire organizations
in America are the lumbermen’s co-operative patrols inaugurated in the
Pacific Northwest and now spreading eastward. Most of our best State
forest legislation has been promoted by lumbermen. Where this is not
true, we can make it true quickest, as Judge Lindsay has found with
his boys, not by censure and compulsion that make them sullen or antagonistic,
but by learning their troubles and working with them hand
in hand toward the ends which in the very nature of things must in the
long run be of mutual advantage. And this means that we must talk
a common language; that here, too, forest Conservation must be expressed
in practical terms of fire prevention, just taxation, and business encouragement.</p>

<p>What I have said of propaganda for State and private action applies
to our appeal to the ordinary citizen, with this difference that because
his number is greater, and his interests are more varied, we must add
to the list of our specific personal arguments and to the list of our publicity
mediums for carrying these arguments. Every vocation, every
trait of character, every selfish and unselfish motive, has its best avenue
of approach.</p>

<p>Immediate tangible results come most surely from immediate injury.
Even good laws are of small use unless the public of today is sufficiently
warned to insist on their enforcement. Do not think me lacking in ideals
when I say that our greatest need is vigor and skill in appealing to
human selfishness. The altruist comes to us unsought. But to reach the
hand with the torch, the vote withheld, the word unspoken; we must find
the man, make him listen, and show the cost of forest destruction to his
particular home and pocketbook. We will not have forest Conservation
till we have done this, and we will not do it until we master and apply
the technical knowledge of mediums and psychological appeal that go
into any successful advertising campaign.</p>

<p>The definitions of Conservation I have outlined are those used by the
Western Forestry and Conservation Association. Its field is the five
Pacific forest States—the Nation’s woodlot—containing over half the
country’s standing timber and capable, by reason of rapid growth, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
growing an adequate supply forever. In this field we practice what we
preach. Our constituent local patrol associations spend from $300,000
to three quarters of a million a year, all paid by lumbermen, but protecting
your resources and mine.</p>

<p>Our booklet reached that school boy and three hundred thousand
more. Through every modern avenue of publicity—newspapers, circulars,
posters, railroad folders, telephone directories and a dozen others—we
carry the lessons of forest economics to every citizen in terms
he can best understand and apply. Although you had not made that
scientific man style himself a conservationist, we had secured his help
in passing a model fire law. We wrote that law. Under it State, Government
and lumbermen work hand in hand to protect practically every
forest acre, sharing the cost, and the lumbermen in that one State contribute
$150,000 a year.</p>

<p>But, best of all, we provide a common meeting ground for all four
agencies in our entire territory, each having the hearty support and
confidence of the others, and we talk only of our joint business of actual,
practical, constructive work. We talk not needs, but methods, and find
means to apply the methods.</p>

<p>We believe in this National Congress of Conservationists. We think
it will enter a permanent future of still higher usefulness when it develops
a more sectional organization, giving the real workers in every
branch opportunity to get the very most out of meeting their own colleagues,
and this not only in the technique of application but also in the
lagging art of promoting the prosperity insurance of Conservation in
terms and policies the public can understand and cannot evade.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—It will now be necessary to drop a curtain in
order to arrange a screen for the illustrated lectures that are going to
follow, so everyone will retain their seats. We shall not be detained
long. While the curtain is dropped, Secretary Shipp will make some
announcements.</p>


<p>The announcements were made by the Secretary.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Report, Comittee on Education</span></h3>
<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—Dr. C. E. Bessey, of the University of Nebraska,
having now arrived, will read his valuable report for the Standing Committee
on Education:</p>


<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bessey</span>—Your committee recognizing that in the field of education
we must for a time provide for a propaganda of suggestion and information,
to be followed ultimately, when the public mind has been
adequately wakened, with plans for a campaign of aggressive activity,
now presents the following as a preliminary report. And while we feel
confident that even at this stage something may be done more than the
inauguration of a campaign of agitation, it is certain, nevertheless, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
it is agitation more than anything else that we can best promote at the
present time. And we must not belittle the importance of this stage
of our work, for in every great movement there is first the period of
agitation during which the “seers of visions and the dreamers of dreams”
talk, and urge, and plead, with increasing vehemence and increasing
confidence.</p>

<p>It is our privilege now to promote such a work of agitation. Accordingly
our suggestions are all made with reference to this preliminary
phase of our work.</p>

<p>There are three principal lines along which this preliminary work
may be developed—namely, in the communities, in the schools, and in our
law-making bodies.</p>


<p class="center">I. WORK IN THE COMMUNITY.</p>

<p>Here we have to change the feeling of apathy, and carelessness, and
irresponsibility, to one of active, conscientious responsibility. In this
task we have to deal with the men and women and children who constitute
the community. We must influence all of them. We must
reach them in such a way that there will grow up in the
community a better feeling with regard to the world we live
in, and a clearer appreciation of our relation to it in every way.
They must be led to see that the world is to be used, not destroyed. Just
as the child has to be taught that his toy is to be enjoyed, and played
with, but not wantonly destroyed, so we must bring the men and women
in the community to see that preservation, and not destruction, is the
higher duty. That citizen is the better one who leaves to the next generation
a better world than he found; whose use of Nature’s soil, and
water, and plants, and animals, leaves Nature still the rich storehouse
in which others after him may find these unimpaired, and in abundance.</p>

<p>How shall such a high sense of responsibility be developed in the community?
How may we awaken this larger and deeper altruism? How
can we bring the men and women of this generation to see that they
are stewards of their Master’s estate?</p>

<p>Your committee commends three agencies as rendering effective
service:</p>

<p>(a) <em>Public Lectures.</em> For these we may rely upon public spirited
men who are primarily interested in Conservation, as well as many whose
affiliations to different branches of natural science have prepared them
to appreciate the purposes of this propaganda. To these we may add
the great number of ministers of the gospel who nearly to a man may
be depended upon to favor the movement, and to speak for it as occasion
offers. Last of all we may confidently enumerate the teachers in the
public schools and the higher educational institutions, and from them
we may certainly secure many regularly prepared addresses and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
more less formal short helpful talks. The influence of all of these presentations
can scarcely be measured beforehand, but we confidently predict
that in a few years we shall find that there has been a decided change
in the general attitude of the community from one of ignorant indifference
to a more or less intelligent interest.</p>

<p>(b) <em>Articles in the Public Press.</em> We believe in the power of the
public press as a molder of the opinions of the community, and feel
that we must enlist the interest and co-operation of the newspapers
throughout the country. To do this generally will require carefully considered,
nation-wide plans; but a great deal may be done in every locality
by the printing of the addresses referred to above. Where this is not
possible abstracts may always be published, as well as summaries of
shorter talks and discussions. Now and then a short, pointed article
should be prepared and printed in the local paper. Here we feel the
need of admonishing writers to be brief. No communication should attempt
to be exhaustive. Better far to say a little at a time, and to come
back to the subject again and again, than to say it all at once. Short,
suggestive articles are generally read, while long ones usually become
so dry that few read them.</p>

<p>(c) <em>Books and Pamphlets.</em> For certain classes of people the appeal
through the more permanent form of publication is far more effective,
and therefore there is in our work a need of the book writer, and the
writer of pamphlets. Here, quite naturally the writer must possess to
a marked degree the ability to present the matter in such a sustained way
that his book or pamphlet will be read throughout. Probably the most
effective writing of this class is that which appears in our illustrated
magazines where by the aid of half-tone reproductions of striking photographs
the interest of the reader is held much more certainly. Such
articles collected into small books or pamphlets would go far towards
stimulating a proper state of mind in regard to the conservation of our
natural resources.</p>

<p>It occurs to us also to suggest that now and then our state experiment
stations might quite legitimately devote a bulletin to Conservation.</p>


<p class="center">II. WORK IN THE SCHOOLS.</p>

<p>While the community as a whole is receiving such suggestions as are
possible through the agencies mentioned—lectures, addresses, newspaper
articles, books and pamphlets—there is a vastly more effective means at
our disposal in the public schools, dealing as they do with no less than
twenty millions of children. We suggest that teachers everywhere be
urged to include in all the studies that pertain to nature something in
regard to the preservation of natural objects. This need not be much in
amount, and it should be brought in with care and wisdom. We are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
reminded that once a very good cause was much discredited in the
schools by the rash unwisdom of its advocates who insisted upon such
an overdose of advice and admonishment that acute nausea resulted. So
we would suggest that in the following studies care should be taken on
the one hand to suggest conservation while on the other hand still
greater care should be taken not to overdo the matter.</p>

<p>(a) <em>Nature Study.</em> Along with an appreciation of Nature there
should be inculcated the feeling that others after us should have the
opportunity of enjoying the same beauties that we have.</p>

<p>(b) <em>Geography.</em> As now generally presented this deals more with
the earth and what it contains, than with its political divisions. Thus
the soil, the forest cover, the streams, the water supply, all fall within
this rejuvenated science, and here most readily can be inculcated the principles
of conservation, as applied to the soil, the forests, the streams,
and the underground waters.</p>

<p>(c) <em>Botany.</em> When the pupil’s attention is more specifically drawn
to the plant covering of the earth, in the study of botany, it is not at all
difficult to impress upon him the desirability of preserving the vegetation
of the present day for the generations that are to come after us.
No lover of plants can contemplate with pleasure the thought that for
the botanists of the twenty-first century certain curious orchids, some
rare trees, and possibly some Golden Rods, may be as completely extinct
as are the Paleozoic Calamites and Lepidodendrids. The latter perished
from the face of the earth, and we know of them now only by the fragments
that have been preserved in the fossils which we dig up from the
old rocks. Extinction has been the fate of many a plant, and extinction
of plants now living is by no means improbable. The botanical teacher
should preach the doctrine of preservation, the preservation of the plants
of the present for the people who come after us.</p>

<p>(d) <em>Zoölogy.</em> So, too, the teacher of zoölogy should improve his
opportunity to help create a feeling favorable to the conservation of the
present animal life. Especially do we need a propaganda of conservation
in relation to the birds of the country. And here we remark that
there are methods of presenting this part of zoölogy which emphasize
rather the living bird in the tree than the dead bird in the cabinet.
And these methods are happily displacing those that suggested if not
required the death of every bird studied. We are well aware of the
fact that it is not so much the killing of birds for study that threatens
the extinction of some species, as the wanton killing for the sake of
killing, and as in the case of birds of fine plumage, the killing for the
money value of the dead birds. Yet we realize that the place to begin is
to educate the children of the schools not to kill birds for any purpose.
When they have regard for the life of a bird they may be trusted not
to kill one needlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>(e) <em>Geology.</em> In this the pupil comes to see the foundations of the
earth, fortunately little of which man may injure or deface. And yet
how thankful we are that on the hills of New England there have been
preserved in their original ruggedness the great masses of granite that
have withstood the elements for millions of years. And who is not
gratified that the great wall of the Palisades on the Hudson River has
been saved for all time? These cliffs were valuable for crushing into
gravel for road-making, and for the quarrying of building stone, but
certain men of finer sensibilities felt that the Palisades had a far higher
value for their grandeur and beauty. And so the Palisades were saved.</p>

<p>We need more of this fine sense of the value of rocks, and lakes, and
waterfalls, and cliffs, and mountains, and of the need of their preservation.</p>

<p>(f) <em>Conservation Clubs.</em> Aside from much that may be done in
school classes to foster a spirit of conservation something further may
be accomplished by taking advantage of the club forming instinct of
children. Conservation clubs, Conservation leagues, Conservation guilds,
pacts, societies, or what-not, may be suggested by the wise teacher, who
can discreetly keep himself in the background while the youngsters do
the work. If a nauseating namby-pambyism can be avoided such clubs
may be joined by even the most vigorous of boys, the very class in whom
it is desirable to develop the spirit of conservation.</p>


<p class="center">III. WORK THROUGH LEGISLATION.</p>

<p>What has been already outlined is probably enough for the present,
but the American people are not satisfied unless something is done in the
way of enacting our ideas into laws. In the present condition of society
we act as though we thought it quite impossible to do anything on a large
scale without having the sanction of a direct law in regard to it. We are
only very slowly learning that some of the best of human activities have
been developed independently of legislation, and no doubt the time will
come when we shall not be so anxious to have our plans formulated into
laws found in our statute books. But for the present we may suggest
the following legislation as helpful. We purposely avoid suggesting
the passage of laws dealing with details. They must come later, when
the conservation sense of the public has been adequately aroused. Here
we may consider state and national laws.</p>

<p>(a) <em>State Laws.</em> These may well include those intended to preserve
rare birds, and in some places certain rare plants which are in danger
of extermination. To these may also be added provisions for the preservation
of important natural features, as forests, waterfalls or massive
rocks that lend interest or beauty to the general landscape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>(b) <em>National Laws.</em> These may deal with larger problems, as the
preservation of certain widely distributed birds. Naturally, too, it is
the National Government that must take the initiative in regard to the
conservation of the great forests, waterways, waterfalls, and the features
in the national parks and reserves.</p>

<p>Carefully drawn laws, both State and National, covering the foregoing
will no doubt aid the cause of Conservation. Too much must not
be attempted. More good will result from a constant vigilance with
regard to the passage of bad laws which give away the heritage of the
community, than from attempts now to formulate a general conservation
code.</p>

<p style="text-align:right;">Committee.</p>

<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—We have all been very much interested in this
valuable contribution to Conservation, coming from such distinguished
contributors as were on this committee, and I desire, for the officers of
the Conservation Congress, to thank the committee for its admirable
report. I feel that every delegate here would like to join in an expression
of thanks for such an interesting and such a helpful paper, which
will go forth to all sections of the country. All those who desire to so
express thanks please rise to their feet. (The entire audience rose to
its feet.)</p>

<p>This is a very grateful and pleasant expression of thanks. I thank
you.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Illustrated Address, “Bird Slaughter and the Cost of Living”</span></h3>
<p>We will now be entertained by an illustrated address by Dr. T. Gilbert
Pearson, of New York City, Secretary of the National Association
of Audubon Societies. The subject is “Bird Slaughter and the Cost of
Living.”</p>


<p>(Dr. Pearson’s address, which, unfortunately, was not recorded by
the official reporter, was heard with keenest interest by a large audience
and was interrupted by frequent applause. The speaker prefaced his
illustrated lecture with a vivid statement of wild life conditions, which
was heard with closest attention.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—I am sure you have been entertained by the very
excellent address we have just heard. And there is another interesting
address to follow. I want every one of you to know we are having a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
very interesting Congress and a very large attendance. This afternoon
there have been three section meetings going on: one, I understand, with
about one thousand people in attendance. All belong to the Conservation
Congress.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Address and Illustrated Lecture, “Federal Protection of Migratory Birds”</span></h3>
<p>We will now listen to a discussion of “Federal Protection of Migratory
Birds,” by Dr. W. T. Hornaday, Director of the New York Zoölogical
Park.</p>


<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hornaday</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The subject
presented to this Congress by the Committee on Conservation of Wild
Life is one of the most practical subjects that you could possibly imagine.
It touches the market basket and the dinner pail, and I know of nothing
that can come much closer home to a family than that. Within the last
three months, in the City of New York, we have had riots in our streets
on account of the high cost of certain articles of food.</p>

<p>Whenever I have an opportunity to stand before an audience and
speak in behalf of wild life, “I would that my tongue could utter the
thoughts that arise in me.”</p>

<p>We have reached the period now when it is absolutely necessary for us
to adjust our ideas according to new conditions. I am trying to place
before you conditions as they exist throughout the United States today,
and I think when that has been done the facts will suggest to you the logical
conclusion. The trouble is that our system of protecting wild life
is nine-tenths absolutely wrong. We are confronted today by a slaughter
of wild life throughout the whole United States, throughout the whole
continent of North America, and throughout the world, that is absolutely
appalling.</p>

<p>Now, in the City of New York there are several national organizations
which make it their business to keep in touch with the conditions
of wild life throughout the world. Unless a person takes pains to keep
in touch with those conditions, as those national organizations do, you
lose sight of the things that are actually going on and which ought to
be of common knowledge. But our lives are so busy, there is so much
to do, the days are so short, and we are so pressed for time that we grasp
only the things that come close to us.</p>

<p>Now, take the slaughter of bird life, it is not like the cutting down
of a forest. When a forest is cut down the stumps are left to be constant
reminders of the destruction for days, for weeks and for years. When
your bird life is destroyed, it simply fades from view. It fails to return
in the spring and you go about your day’s business and you see the beauties
of the forest and field, but you forget to what extent the birds have
disappeared. It is a difficult thing to obtain an accurate estimate of the
decrease in the general volume of wild bird life throughout a given year,
but it is possible to obtain such estimates. Now, there is in the United<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
States a tremendous force at work destroying wild life. The force that is
preserving wild life is not nearly so large and not nearly so active. I
will show you presently a picture especially designed to bring this home
to you. Dr. Pearson has set before you many beautiful pictures showing
bird life in protected areas. That points an important moral which I do
not wish to forget. It means that if we are diligent, if we reform our
system and our laws we can to a very large extent bring back the vanished
bird life. There is hope for the future. Today we are confronted
by the prospect of a country gameless and birdless everywhere except in
the protected areas. We all know how important the game preserves and
the protected bird areas are. We cannot have too many of them; they
cannot be too large. But there is a vast volume of bird life that cannot
be protected in the preserves, the migratory phase of bird life, which we
cannot control except for short periods of the year.</p>

<p>I believe that the subject we are now bringing before you is one in
which it is possible for the members of this Conservation Congress to
achieve a practical result of the greatest magnitude and in the shortest
possible time and with the least effort of any subject that will be presented
to this Congress. I know that is a large order, but I think that
before I conclude you will agree with me that my proposition is not
exaggerated.</p>

<p>When I was assured that I could have the honor and the privilege
of speaking to this Congress on the subject of wild life, the first thought
that occurred to me was to endeavor to place before you some ocular
proof of the slaughter of wild life that is now going on at so terrific a
rate. I gathered from my side table a collection of pictures that had
dropped into my hands from various portions of the United States and
outside, and those pictures I wish you to see now. They will tell a story
of their own with very few words from me, and after that we will come
to the logical conclusion.</p>


<p>Dr. Hornaday here gave an illustrated lecture which was thoroughly
enjoyed.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The Congress will now stand adjourned until 8:15
o’clock this evening, when Dr. Harvey W. Wiley will speak, at Tomlinson
Hall.</p>

<p>The Congress was called to order by President White, in Tomlinson
Hall, at 8:30 o’clock p. m.</p>

<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—We are a little late opening this meeting, because
we are trying to do so much in different places, and we do not all get in
one place at the same time. But I am glad to see such an enthusiastic
meeting here tonight. The audience will rise while the Rev. Dr. Allan
B. Philputt, of the Central Christian Church of this city, invokes the
Divine blessing.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">INVOCATION.</span></h3>
<p class="center">INVOCATION.</p>

<p><em>Lord, our God, we ask that Thy blessing may rest upon us in what we
believe is work well-pleasing to Thee and for the upbuilding and welfare
of our common humanity. We pray Thee, bless Thy servants who have
gathered here to instruct and lead us on with the mighty host of those
who are willing to follow in the good ways that shall be pointed out for
the preservation, not only of our material resources, but for our moral,
intellectual and spiritual well-being. We pray that strength may be
given those who lead, and guidance and light, and the heartiest co-operation
on the part of all our citizenship. May we be interested in these
things which will add to our happiness, and wealth, and peace and plenty,
and by which we may also come to a better knowledge of Thee and Thy
laws. May Thy blessing rest upon all the sessions of this great Congress,
especially upon those who have sacrificed time and means to come here
and give themselves unreservedly to this great cause. May Thy favor
rest upon those present, may Thy blessing be upon those who are
strangers within our city, and may hospitality be unbounded, may sympathy
and cordiality flow from heart to heart until we feel the strong
ties that bind us, not only in one State, but with every State in our
great Republic. This we ask through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.</em></p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—I have a communication to read to this audience
from an old, well-known and well-loved conservationist, one of the great
leaders in conservation work. I do not think there is any politics in this.
I will read it.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">
<p style="text-align:right;">“Omaha, Neb., September 30, 1912.</p>

<p>Capt. J. B. White, National Conservation Congress, Indianapolis:
</p>

<p>Please tell the Congress I am keenly sorry to be away. I should be with you,
except that I believe I can do the cause of Conservation more good where I am.
We are working to make this continent a better home for a better race. It is a
great task. I wish you the best of meetings and complete success.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">GIFFORD PINCHOT.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:right;">GIFFORD PINCHOT.”</p></div>

<p>The speaker of this evening is well known to us all. He has impressed
himself and his subject upon the people of this great country in the past<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
few years, and he needs no introduction from me. I have long wanted
to know how old people managed to grow old and keep looking young. I
do not mean to infer that the speaker of this evening is getting old, as
I understand he has a boy only about a year old (applause); but I have
found out his age, by persistent and tactful undertaking, and, being
in pursuit of some way of living to a good old age myself, I inquired
as to his habits. I will not give them to you now, except to say that he
told me, briefly and epigrammatically, that he doesn’t smoke, he doesn’t
drink (applause), he doesn’t chew, and he says he doesn’t swear (applause)—only
occasionally. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>I now take great pleasure in introducing to you Dr. Harvey W.
Wiley, who will speak on the subject “The Conservation of Man.”
(Applause.)</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Conservation of Man”</span></h3>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Wiley</span>—The National Conservation Congress has at its previous
meetings discussed in a most illuminating and helpful way the great
problems of Conservation as applied to the soil, to the forests, to the
mines, and to the running streams.</p>

<p>I do not suppose it is proper, with an audience of this kind, to refer
to earlier papers, but I do believe I am the first person who ever made
a public address in this country upon the subject of Conservation, and
I am certain, as far as I know, that I am the last one that is making such
an address. But as long ago as 1893 and being a very old man, as you
have heard, I can remember that far back—I made an address on the
conservation of the soil, so I am really the father of the conservation
movement in this country as well as of a very fine boy. (Applause.)
I miss my dear friend, Gifford Pinchot, whom I love as a brother, but
who has fallen into the patent medicine habit and is giving us “absent
treatment.” I am not at all sure that he is doing a better work out there
than he would be here. In the words of the Scotch poet, “I hae ma
doots.” But still we were glad to hear from him and know he has not
lost interest because of the strenuous political life he is now compelled to
lead.</p>

<p>With this great work, from its inception, I have been in deepest sympathy
and have collaborated in such a manner as I could to further it.
The work accomplished has produced benefits which are difficult to
measure by any standard which can be properly appreciated. The
American people have come to believe in the application of a single
standard of value and this is a scientific principle with which, as a rule,
I would have no quarrel, but unfortunately the single standard which
Americans have been taught to value is that which pertains to the
almighty dollar. The Conservation Congress, however, has not been blind
to the fact that the standards of ethics, health, morality and happiness
are of even far greater value than that of money. Nevertheless, in order<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
to present the subject in a manner easily grasped by the American people,
attempts have been made to measure the value of health and life by a
money standard. As a justification of this, we have the procedures of the
courts, based upon statutory enactments, which fix a money value upon
life, although in many cases, after mature deliberation, it has been
found that the life for which compensation has been asked, was of small
value. In like manner, in the treatises which have been written on the
public health and its value as a national asset, it has been attempted to
portray in dollars the most precious of all human possessions, namely,
life. And, in point of fact, it is not wholly unscientific, though undoubtedly
unsentimental, to thus value human existence. All useful members
of a community render services of some kind, for which payment is made
in the coin of the realm. Following one of the established customs of
great financial operations, it has been customary to capitalize the human
life on its earning capacity, either active or prospective. The infant and
the child, measured upon an actual earning capacity, would have practically
no value, but this would be an unscientific method of determining
worth, because of the fact that the infant and the child represent the
necessary preparatory stages of earning capacity. Based upon this fact
they both have a real monetary value.</p>

<p>I shall not take up the time of this address with any effort to ascertain
the actual values which may safely be assigned to the infant, the
child, and the grown-up person. This has been carefully and sufficiently
accomplished by other investigators. Abraham Lincoln said that
in so far as efficiency is concerned the human race may be divided into
three classes, namely, one, those who work effectively; two, those who
work to no purpose, and three, those who do not work at all. Judging
by rigid standards which have been set up by students of efficiency,
class one is probably the least numerous of the three. Class two is
composed of well-meaning people who do work, are willing to work,
and anxious to work, but who do not know how, and therefore waste
their energies. Class three is made up of the idle rich, the idle poor,
and that considerable portion of our population incapacitated by disease
or otherwise exempt from taking part in any useful employment.</p>


<p class="center">FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF THE CONSERVATION OF MAN.</p>

<p>Primarily, in the study of the conservation of human efficiency,
that is of man, man himself and knowledge of what he is, and what he
has been, within the years in which man has been studied, in a scientific
way, is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, we have not access
to a universal system of demography, inasmuch as only a few countries
have adopted scientific demography in its entirety. The world descriptions
of human life, health, and efficiency are, therefore, exceedingly fragmentary.
We are too apt to base our ideas upon personal acquaintance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
and knowledge of the efficiency of man, than upon a scientific study
thereof, and yet, in order to have a proper view of the subject of the
conservation of man, the actual state of his health and his capacity for
useful labor must engage our attention.</p>

<p>The Division of Vital Statistics of the Census Bureau has done much
to furnish the student of humanity with fundamental data, and first of
all let us consider what is the expectation of life in the various countries
according to the latest authorities which can be secured. The Division of
Vital Statistics has prepared the following table, which is to be accepted
as the most authoritative which is accessible. No claim is made, of
course, for entire accuracy, but it is sufficient to show what the condition
was in this country twelve years ago. It is reasonable to suppose
that conditions have improved somewhat in the twelve years which
have passed since the compilation of the data submitted.</p>


<p class="center">EXPECTATION OF LIFE IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES ACCORDING TO
LATEST LIFE TABLES.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>(The “expectation of life” is sometimes known as the “mean after-life time,”
“average after-life time,” “mean duration of life,” and “average duration of

<p>One of the most remarkable facts presented by the above table is in
the marked increase in the expectation of life after the age of one year.
In other words, the terrible infant mortality, which prevails in all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
countries, is so great that the expectation of life at birth is a number
of years less than at the age of one year. In England and Wales, the
infant mortality decreases the expectation of life at birth, in round
numbers by eight years; in France and Italy about the same; in Austria,
by eleven years; in Sweden, by six years; in the German Empire, by
eleven years; in Massachusetts, by nine years. In the report, of the
Bureau of the Census on Mortality Statistics, printed in 1909, and
referring to the calendar year 1908, data are collected from seventeen
States, the District of Columbia, and seventy-four registration cities,
comprising a total of 51.8 per cent. of the total estimated population of
the country. The total number of deaths registered in this area in 1908
is 691,574, corresponding to a death rate of 15.4 per 1,000 of population,
which is said to indicate a remarkably favorable condition of the public
health.</p>

<p>In the mortality statistics for 1910, two years later, the registration
area, which included in 1910 an estimated midyear population of 58.3
per cent. of the total population of continental United States, the deaths
reported were 805,412, representing a death rate of 15 per 1,000 population.
The death rate for 1909 was only 14.4 per 1,000. While these
variations are marked, the work has not been carried on for a sufficient
length of time to do more than to warrant an expression of opinion that
the death rate in this country is generally receding. It varies as shown,
on both sides, having decreased very considerably from 1907 to 1909, but
increased to a very marked degree in 1910 over 1909. The registration
area covers the following States in toto, and some of the principal
cities in the other States: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina (municipalities of
1,000 population and over in 1900), Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.</p>

<p>The extension of the system of registration to a larger area and number
of population and the improvement in the efficiency of securing
data are all to be considered in comparisons of very small periods of
time. For one hundred million of population a death rate of 15 per
1,000 indicates a total of 1,500,000 deaths per annum. This figure may
be accepted as being sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes at
the present time as representing the death rate of today in the United
States.</p>

<p>Comparing the United States with other countries and giving the
expectation of life at birth as the basis of comparison, we may safely
assume that the average expectation of life for the United States is in
round numbers 44 years. Comparing this with the other countries we
find that Sweden, Holland and New South Wales have a lower death
rate than the United States. England, France, Belgium and Holland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
have almost the same death rate. The German Empire and Austria
have a higher death rate. India is the banner country for shortness
of life, the expectation of life in India being a little over half that in
the United States.</p>


<p class="center">WHAT ARE THE DISEASES WHICH ARE MOST ACTIVE IN CAUSING THE DEATH
OF OUR PEOPLE?</p>

<p>In the registration area of 1910, 154,373 infants under one year of
age died, in round numbers one-fifth of all the deaths. Assuming the
total deaths to be 1,500,000, the number of children dying in the United
States every year under the age of one year is 300,000. A striking
illustration of the danger of the hot months for children under 2 years
of age is shown by the fact that the number of deaths from diarrhœa
and enteritis for July and August was 12,535 and 12,565 respectively,
while in February the deaths from the same causes were 1,373. From
these data it is evident that during the hot two months nearly 1,000
infants under the age of one year die every day in the United States.</p>

<p>The report of the Division of Vital Statistics shows that beginning
with the second month of life diarrhœa is the most serious cause of
infant mortality. While infantile diarrhœa and its allied disease, enteritis,
is the most frequent cause of death among infants, the greatest
destroyer of the human race, without respect to age, is tuberculosis,
which caused 10.7 per cent. of the deaths from all causes in 1910.
Next in importance in destructiveness is found organic disease of the
heart, causing 9.5 per cent. of all the deaths. For all ages diarrhœa and
enteritis come third in fatality with 7.8 per cent. Close after this
comes pneumonia with 6.7 per cent. Kidney disease causes a mortality
of 6.6 per cent.</p>

<p>The number of deaths from tuberculosis during the year 1910 was
160.3 per 100,000, or for 100,000,000 people 160,300. The death rate
from tuberculosis from 1900 to 1909, inclusive, was 183 per 100,000.
Apparently the death rate for tuberculosis is decreasing.</p>

<p>The number of deaths from cancer in 1910 was 76.2 per 100,000, or
a total of 76,200; the highest death rate ever recorded from cancer. Evidently
the deaths from career are increasing in proportion to the
population.</p>

<p>I wish sometimes that every house in this country could be burned to
the ground, if the people could escape. Why? Because tuberculosis
and cancer are house diseases, and if every house were burned, we
would not have them any more—at least until we built new houses. But
we can purify our houses, we can live out doors, we can sleep out doors
most of the year, and by the teaching and practicing of the principles
of hygiene and sanitation we need not burn our houses at all. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
people do not know, and worse than that, they do not care. They take
no interest in such things. If you were discussing the tariff tonight, the
house would not hold the people; if you were discussing trusts, there
would be no standing room; but when you discuss this tariff on human
life—they are not interested.</p>

<p>Organic disease of the heart: The number of deaths in 1910 was
141.5 per 100,000, which is a very large increase over that of the preceding
year of 129.7 per 100,000. The total number of deaths from
heart disease was 141,500.</p>

<p>Pneumonia: The death rate from pneumonia for 1910 was 147.7
per 100,000, making a total of 147,700 deaths from this disease. The
death rate from this disease increased considerably over that of the
preceding year.</p>

<p>Kidney disease: The total number of deaths from kidney disease in
1910 was 99 per 100,000, making a total of 99,000 for an estimated population
of 100,000,000. This includes all forms of kidney trouble,
nephritis and Bright’s disease.</p>

<p>Typhoid fever: The death rate from typhoid fever was 23.5 per
100,000, a total of 23,500 for the estimated population of 100,000,000.</p>

<p>You older men like me who were in the war know that war is hell—not
because you are shot—that is glory; but because you die of disease;
and if you will read the military history of the Civil War, so-called
(I do not know why, for it was not so very “civil”) you will see that
while one man died of wounds, four died of disease, because we did not
understand the principles of serum prophylaxis. We are not going to
have in the next war four men die of fever where one is killed in battle.</p>

<p>One of the curious features in connection with typhoid fever is that
some of the most sparsely settled States show the highest rates of fatality,
for instance the number of people dying in Colorado of typhoid
fever is 41.9; in Montana, 39.9, and Utah, 37 per 100,000. Only
one of the thickly populated States equals this—Maryland, 40.7
per 100,000. Some of the lowest death rates for typhoid fever were
found in New Hampshire, 10.7; Massachusetts, 12.4; Rhode Island,
13.6; Vermont, 14; New Jersey, 14.5, and Connecticut, 14.7. Of cities of
100,000 population or over in 1910, Omaha, Nebraska, showed the highest
rate, namely, 86.7; Minneapolis, Minn., 58.7; Kansas City, Mo., 54.4;
Atlanta, Ga., 50.1; Birmingham, Ala., 49.5; Nashville, Tenn., 48.9; Milwaukee,
Wis., 45.7; Spokane, Wash., 45.4, and Baltimore, Md., 42. The
lowest rates shown for some of the large cities were those of Bridgeport,
Conn., 4.9; Paterson, N. J., 7.1; Cincinnati, O., 8.8, and Cambridge,
Mass., 9.5 per 100,000. These cities seemingly are as well protected
against typhoid fever as some of the cities of Europe, where death rates
are as follows: London, 4; Edinburgh, 2; Dublin, 10; Paris, 7; Brussels,
19; Amsterdam, 7; Copenhagen, 3; Stockholm, 4; Christiania, 2; Berlin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
4, and Vienna, 4 per 100,000. Thus, evidently in such cities as Cincinnati,
Berlin and London, death from typhoid fever is no longer a terror.</p>

<p>Measles, which is supposed to be almost a harmless disease, causes
a large number of deaths, the death rate for 1910 being 12.3 per 100,000
population, or a total of 12,300 for the estimated population. In some
cities the number of deaths by measles was almost as high as that by
typhoid fever, notably in Pittsburgh, Pa., 33.1; Providence, R. I., 31.9;
Kansas City, Mo., 28.4; Lowell, Mass., 28.1; Albany, N. Y., 23.9; Columbus,
O., 23.6; Buffalo, N. Y., 22.1, and Richmond, Va., 21.1 per 100,000.
Scarlet fever is not so deadly a disease as measles, since the fatalities per
100,000 for 1910 was 11.6. Death rates from this disease were high in
the following cities of 100,000 population or over: Buffalo, N. Y., 53.6;
Lowell, Mass., 41.2; St. Paul, Minn., 30.2; St. Louis, Mo., 27.1; Kansas
City, Mo., 23.2; Milwaukee, Wis., 22.3; Pittsburgh, Pa., 22.2; Rochester,
N. Y., 21.4, and New York, N. Y., 20 per 100,000.</p>

<p>Whooping cough produced as many deaths as measles and scarlet
fever, the death rate for 1910 being 11.4 per 100,000 population. Diphtheria
and croup produced a death rate of 21.4 per 100,000 population,
or a total of 21,400 for the estimated population.</p>

<p>Influenza, or “la grippe,” caused a death rate of 14.4 per 100,000
population for 1910. This disease is less prevalent than for the preceding
ten years. The above data are sufficient to show the principal
causes of death, old age, unfortunately, being so small a factor as to be
almost negligible in the compilation.</p>

<p>It might be interesting to extend these vital statistics to a greater
length, but a sufficient number of data have been given to establish some
of the fundamental principles which should guide physicians and the
sanitarians of the future in their work.</p>


<p class="center">THE MEANS OF AVOIDING AVOIDABLE DEATH.</p>

<p>The question which is now presented for discussion at this Congress
is, How can avoidable death be successfully avoided? I have not included
in the discussion of this question the deaths by accident, which
are lamentably all too frequent in this country. The motor car, the
aeroplane, the railway, and the steamboat, still continue their deadly
work in increasing violence as our population grows denser. It is easy
to understand how the State could do much toward preventing these
unfortunate accidents. No doubt concerted action on the part of the
States will soon be perfected to prevent so many of the horrible catastrophes,
whose descriptions form the principal reading matter, after
murder and suicide, in the morning journals. And this leads us to say
that murder as a means of ending human life is more prevalent in this
country than in any other country of the world, and in consideration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
of the features which relate to the conservation of man the prevention
of murder should receive particular attention.</p>

<p>A study of the above data reviewed in connection with the known
etiology of disease, shows clearly where the work of the conservation of
man, especially by the prevention of disease, should begin and on what
line it should be prosecuted. To this end it is sufficient to call attention
to the fact that diseases are naturally divided into two classes: those
which are communicated and those which are produced by the conditions
of the personal environment. Physicians are pretty well agreed at the
present time that disease is rarely inherited, therefore, most of the
causes which produce death are those which come from without, or
those which are developed from within by improper habits of life. But
one may inherit deficient vitality and thus fall an easy victim to an infectious
disease. The point for us to consider most particularly in this
connection, is to what extent we can prevent these diseases, that is, those
which are contracted from without.</p>


<p class="center">EDUCATION OF FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE.</p>

<p>It would be well to classify the efforts which we are making for the
prevention of disease in some systematic order. I will begin, therefore,
with the one which is the most important of all, and that is education.</p>

<p>In order to secure proper protection for the citizen, he must be made
to understand that he needs it. Further than this, it must be made plain
that the protection of the individual from communicable disease is not
by any means wholly within his own power. Unless the State acts, the
individual in many cases is powerless; hence education beginning in the
family, continued in the public school, and illustrated in practical adult
life, is the most important feature of prophylaxis. Into the details of
education I cannot go, but one thing I do with to insist upon, namely,
that the child should be taught early, frequently and constantly, that
most of the disease he has to fear are like enemies in the dark. I
need not refer again by detail to the statistics of mortality, but simply
would say that if the diseases which produce some of the most deadly
inroads into humanity, such as tuberculosis, measles, whooping cough,
scarlet fever, diphtheria, croup and typhoid fever, are solely communicated
to the individual from without, they are the diseases which the
State must help the individual to avoid. On the other hand, organic
diseases of the heart, nephritis and Bright’s disease, are apparently more
of a personal character, due either to inherited weak qualities or to
errors of diet or faults of metabolism. These are diseases which we
should be taught to avoid by strict attention to personal hygiene. They
are not, so far as known, communicable, and therefore the State can do
little, aside from educational work, towards their prevention. Another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
disease which may be partly communicated and partly the result of
improper nutrition, is enteritis, and especially infantile diarrhœa, diseases
which by proper education might be almost wholly avoided.</p>


<p class="center">DISEASES OF UNKNOWN GENESIS.</p>

<p>There remain two great causes of human death, namely, cancer and
pneumonia, which are still practically beyond control, because of our
ignorance of their etiology or our powerlessness to prevent their progress.
These diseases are considered communicable, that is, they are induced
by specific infection, but the methods and the exact nature of the
infecting germs are still subjects of investigation. It is true that we
are told of the organism which produces pneumonia, and it is said to
be constantly in the mouth of even healthy people, and we read almost
monthly of the discovery of the real cause of cancer, but in spite of all
this, these diseases remain as a rule unknown in character and are
gigantic and terrible enemies which we have to fight in the dark. To
one point attention should be called in regard to the increase in such
diseases as those of the kidneys and the heart, that are essentially diseases
of old age, just as tuberculosis and typhoid fever are diseases
of early life. In proportion as we save people from tuberculosis and
typhoid fever, just in that proportion will we save men and women who
subsequently become victims of old age diseases. Therefore the increase
in the number of deaths due to these causes may be an index to the
increasing longevity of the people, instead of the opposite.</p>

<p>It is of course a question, which unfortunately we are unable to
decide for ourselves, as to whether we should be saved from tuberculosis
and typhoid fever for the express purpose of being killed by cancer,
kidney lesions and diseases of the heart. Upon the whole I think, however,
that terrible as these diseases are, especially cancer, most people
would rather die of cancer at 70 than to succumb to tuberculosis at 30.
But in the great problem of the conservation of human life we must not
lose sight of the fact that many experienced and competent investigators
are devoting their whole time to revealing the secret of these dread diseases,
which still baffle the skill of the physician. We may hope in the
near future that at least pneumonia and cancer may be put upon the
same footing as typhoid and tuberculosis, that their actual genesis will
be disclosed, and thus the road made clear toward their prevention. It
is along these lines that education must go, because we cannot develop a
public sentiment for the protection of life and health except by the
desire of the people to live and be well, and the education of the youth
and the adult is the best method of securing that result. When the
people are educated, then we can successfully introduce the other methods
of saving human life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>


<p class="center">PREVENTION OF COMMUNICABLE DISEASES.</p>

<p>It is a self-evident fact, granting a disease to be of communicable
origin by a specific germ, that the disease may be prevented if its victim
be protected from infection. In other words, such diseases as tuberculosis,
typhoid fever and others of the same character, which are undoubtedly
communicated from individual to individual, could be wholly
exterminated if the opportunities for communication were destroyed.
We may assume, therefore, that all specific diseases due to a specific
organism are capable of elimination by the simple exclusion of the
organism.</p>

<p>Based on this are the great factors of prevention, namely, quarantine
and segregation, which are practically one and the same. It stands
to reason that an infected center should be removed or so isolated as to
be no longer dangerous. For the same reason the infected center should
not be allowed to enter a new community. Based upon this principle our
systems of quarantine and segregation should be greatly strengthened.
It is not a question of the wishes of the individual in this case; if it were,
no ship would be detained and quarantined, and few people would go
to a smallpox hospital or tuberculosis sanitarium. The principle of the
welfare of the race as superior to the interests of the individual is
dominant in these particulars. Tennyson, who foresaw many of the
great truths of science, has beautifully presented this principle in his
well-known stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Are God and nature then at strife,</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">That nature sends such fearful dreams?</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">So careful of the type she seems,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">So careless of the single life.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the protection of the public health it will become as much the
duty of each State and Nation to provide sanitary detention camps
for infectious diseases and rigidly enforce residence therein, as it is to
watch the border and establish strict quarantine.</p>


<p class="center">IMMUNITY.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that it will take a long course of education
and almost revolution in the sentiment of the people, to establish a system
of segregation and quarantine as rigid and as perfect as that which
is outlined. What then is the next best resort? I answer immunization.
If we cannot keep the infectious organism from contact with the human
body, we should endeavor to make the body immune from its ravages.
There are two methods which might be adopted; the one which could be
most generally practiced is that of good nutrition, proper housing, fresh
air, pure water and pure foods. The child that sleeps in the open and
eats an abundance of pure, wholesome foods and takes a proper amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
of exercise, will escape most of the diseases of infancy and grow into
manhood with a body immune to almost every infectious germ. I need
not go into detail in regard to the actual mechanism of immunity to
prove the fact that a well-nourished body, sustained by blood of high
nutritious power and bearing its untold millions of organisms, armed
cap-a-pie to destroy intruders, is a sufficient illustration of immunity.
The physiologists will describe to you the nature of the phagocytose
opsins, and the hormones by means of which this immunity is secured.</p>

<p>For the above reason the campaign for pure and wholesome food
lies at the very foundation of the protection of the public health. It
is a mistaken idea that a food is not to be condemned unless it produces
diseases. A food is to be condemned which is in any way so debased as
to undermine nutrition and impoverish the blood, and thus open the
door of the body to the invitation of every germ that may be coming
along the road. Thus the addition to foods of bodies which in themselves
are not poisonous or harmful, but which debase the product and
make it less palatable or less nutritious, is a crime of the same magnitude
as that of adding to the foods poisonous and deleterious ingredients
or of suffering it to fall into advanced stages of decomposition.</p>

<p>What a sorry spectacle, in the light of these facts, was presented at
the Fifteenth International Congress of Hygiene and Demography at
Washington last week, when Professor Long, member of the Remsen
Board, which has validated the use of some of these poisons, attempted
to justify the addition of an active drug to the food supply of the
nation! Such an act was so foreign to the purposes of the Congress as
to constitute an unpardonable anachronism. Dr. Long was one of the
most enthusiastic protagonists of benzoate of soda in the Federal Court
in Indianapolis when those who secured the appointment of the Referee
Board in defiance of law sought to force the people of Indiana to eat their
adulterated products. The people ask for bread and Dr. Long and his
assistants give them a stone in the form of the moribund benzoate.</p>

<p>Of a similar pernicious and mercenary character was the paper presented
by Professor Sedgewick, of Boston, in which he urged the use of
infected oysters and diseased meats as human foods. Professor Sedgewick
was one of the principal witnesses in the celebrated egg case in New
Jersey, where he testified that eggs so decomposed as to produce death
when injected into guinea pigs were wholly fit for human food if sufficiently
disguised in taste and smell by baking! Oysters, according to
Sedgewick, should be classified into good, to be eaten raw by the rich,
and bad, to be cooked and eaten by the poor. Meats of diseased animals
should also be eaten by the poor, unless so badly diseased as to be physically
seen to be unsound.</p>

<p>This is the doctrine of modern hygiene according to its prophets
Long and Sedgewick. I cannot subscribe to these doctrines. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
plenty of clean food for both rich and poor. To excuse processes of
growing food animals, and manufacturing foods which permit and condone
unsanitary methods and introduce active drugs into the finished
products, stimulates and encourages reprehensible practices, which all
interested in the public health should condemn. Happily the Federal
courts, both in New Jersey and Indiana, were unconvinced by such
specious arguments, and condemned the very processes which were
praised and defended before the world’s congress of sanitarians.</p>

<p>The workers for the conservation of man do not yet fully realize the
great importance of the food supply of the country as a means of producing
immunity of disease. The well-nourished body is clad in armor
and bears an impenetrable shield which enables one to march into the
midst of dangers and for the most part escape unscathed. All power
and ethical spirit, therefore, to the men who are chosen to administer
the food laws, in order that they may realize the importance of their
office to the health of the people, and the life and efficiency of our
citizens. Let them learn to put a heart and a soul into science.</p>


<p class="center">IMMUNITY OF HEREDITY.</p>

<p>We are all familiar with the common phrase, the foundation principle
of eugenics, “He inherited a good constitution.” It is undoubtedly
true that we come into the world with widely different vitalities.
The true principles of scientific immunity to disease therefore lie imbedded
in the human life principles of long past aeons. The ideals of
eugenics, as formulated by Francis Galton and elaborated by his nephew,
the son of the immortal Darwin, are but irridescent dreams. If man is
to be bred scientifically, there must be many selected mothers and a
very few high grade fathers. The human race is not yet ready to face
the problem in the true light of science and contemplate a race of males
of which 75 per cent. are eunuchs. This is kako- instead of eu-genics.
As long as the heart is whole, men and women with only one lung will
fall in love. For untold centuries to come we must be resigned to
human race composed principally of scrubs. But there is one principle
of eugenics which can be and ought to be put into practice. It has
been done partially in some States, especially in Indiana. It should be
generally adopted. The degenerate, the vicious and the imbecile should
not be allowed to propagate. These are classes of society that have no
right to multiply. Before proceeding further in restricting parenthood
let us see that individuals of both sexes, criminally vicious or imbecile,
are segregated or rendered impotent. And even here only the typically
bad cases are to be treated. It would be too nice a question for the jury
if there was a doubt of any kind, even inconsiderable. Among those of
average intelligence, education should do the rest. Teach those who are
physically diseased the duty of celibacy. Persuade and not force them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>


<p class="center">INDUCED IMMUNITY.</p>

<p>Another method of securing immunity in the human organism is by
the development of some morbid condition of a nature similar to or
identical with the disease to be combatted, so as to produce in the system
anti-bodies, specifically adapted to fight the particular disease which has
generated them. The principle of immunization by this method rests
upon the successful experiments, or rather observations, respecting a
given virus. Jenner’s observations in regard to smallpox were purely
empirical, and it remained for Pasteur to develop a scientific basis of
induced immunization. Serum-therapy is by no means half so important
as serum-prophylaxis, and here again comes the importance of education,
because there is still a very large and respectable body of our
citizens who resent any interference on the part of the State with their
rights as regards medical relations. It looks almost like tyranny to
force a citizen to subject himself to inoculation of any kind when his
own belief in the efficacy of the process is hostile and where he resists
enforced immunization. But here again the right of the people asserts
itself and thus justifies compulsory vaccination. While education can
do much to remove this prejudice, we must expect to always have with us
those who conscientiously resent inoculation, and condemn all efforts to
prevent disease.</p>

<p>Since, because of lack of care and proper supervision, grave disorders
and disease and sometimes death result from the practice of inoculation,
the State owes a special duty to its citizens in seeing that all forms of
inoculation materials, no matter what their nature may be, are of the
purest and best. Of course, the thought presents itself that induced
immunization is only a confession of inability to protect the health
by isolation of the invading virus. It is something like the pasteurization
of milk, which is a mute tribute to insanitary conditions, uncleanly
cows, and long keeping; but here it seems that there is no choice left.
The impossibility of complete isolation, at least for many years to come,
is apparent, and hence the desirability of general immunization becomes
obvious. The successful inoculation which has lately been accomplished
against typhoid fever is another promise of what the future may bring
in the way of immunization by induction. Meanwhile it is the part of
wisdom for those who seek the public welfare by the conservation of life
to urge both prophylaxis and immunization, in the hope that the infecting
centers will become so few and so remote that good nutrition, and
all that it implies in a sanitary way, will eventually become a sufficient
protection against communicable diseases.</p>


<p class="center">THE SUPERVISION OF DRUGS.</p>

<p>Hand in hand with the supervision of our food supply, we should
not forget the control of drugs. I am far from believing that drugs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
are an efficient remedy for all human ills; in fact, I am convinced that
they are not. They are at best only adjuncts, except in those cases
where specifics have been discovered, as in the case of quinine and malaria,
and the arsenic compounds, which have proven so useful in combating
syphilis. But without discussing the efficiency of drugs, I think we will
all admit that as long as they are articles of commerce they should be
pure and of constant strength. To this end we should support, with
all our enthusiasm and ability, the efforts which are made to perfect the
pharmacopœia, and to standardize and purify the drugs of commerce.</p>


<p class="center">THE CONSTANT THREAT OF PROPRIETARY MEDICINES.</p>

<p>In this connection I cannot refrain from alluding to one of the greatest
dangers of drugs, and that is, their indiscriminate use by the laity.
The fakers that pretend to find sovereign remedies for every disease,
through the medium of the newspaper and the periodical, of the postal
card and the circular, inflame the minds of the people and induct them
into indiscriminate drugging. One can generally, by taking up a paper
in any locality and scanning its columns even carelessly, see the wonderful
vogue of these fakes and crimes. Such falsely praised substances as
Peruna, Kilmer’s Swamp Root, Duffy’s Malt Whiskey, and the whole
brood of wretched specifics, serve to illustrate the great danger to which
we are subjected. But the worst of it all is that through the carelessness
of physicians, and sometimes through their criminal pretentions,
habits are formed for certain drugs, such as cocaine, opium and its
products, chloral and alcohol, which enslave their victims, weaken their
vitality, and invite disease. I think I do not exaggerate it when I say
that the drug habit, no matter how induced, is a menace to the American
people. No matter how slight the ailment or how easily controlled, the
first advice and the first act is to “take something,” no matter what, or
whoever may recommend it, for every imaginable ailment. The effect of
this continual drugging upon the human body is more easily imagined
than described. The nerves and stomachs of our people are gradually
succumbing to the bombardment of pills, pellets and powders. For the
sake of gain every possible influence is brought to bear upon the American
people to increase the consumption of drugs. The danger is so imminent
and so acute that it is hoped that through the means of education
a public sentiment may yet be awakened in this country which will
protect our people against all these nefarious concoctions. I would not
for a moment in any way curtail the right of citizens to consult accredited
physicians, no matter to what so-called school they might belong;
but it is the duty of the State, as an additional safeguard, to the health
and life of our people, to see to it that no one sets himself up as a physician
unless he has qualified himself in the fundamental principles of
anatomy, hygiene and physiology, to understand the human body and its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
operations. We are too prone to tolerate physicians who tell you that
the blood which supplies the brain passes into the cranium altogether
through the canal of the spinal cord. Charlatanry, quackery, and ignorance
in the practice of medicine should be rigidly suppressed. The
people of the nation who have freedom of choice should not be left helpless
victims of avarice and ignorance.</p>


<p class="center">DANGERS OF STIMULANTS.</p>

<p>In addition to drugs, as commonly considered, the people of our
country are also subjected to imminent dangers in the use of stimuli,
which have no food value and which induce activities that are beyond
the power of the system to sustain. I refer especially to such beverages
as tea, coffee, and alcoholic drinks and the manufactured articles containing
their active principles, such as coca cola and all the great army
of “olas,” and to tobacco, as an illustration of additional dangers to
which we are likely to succumb. In spite of the fragrance of the coffee,
and the aroma of the tea, and the flavor of the rum, and the dreams of
the pipe, I am inclined to the belief that it was a sad day for humanity
when these things were first brought to the attention of man. In so far
as intellectual development is concerned, I find the nations of antiquity,
and especially the powerful nations of Greece and Rome, developed to
be leaders in architecture, masters of painting and sculpture, and
geniuses in poetry and expression, without the aid of any of the stimuli
which the artist, the poet and the writer are supposed to depend upon
today.</p>

<p>It would indeed be a happy day for the community if all of these
stimuli, as appetizing as some of them are, could be relegated to the
scrap heap, and the art of their use forever lost. (Applause.) Meanwhile,
we all understand that this Utopian condition is at present impossible,
and hence we must content ourselves with education and with
legal control to prevent the abuse of these bodies and to eliminate the
injury which they have done. Temperance may always be practiced,
even where prohibition fails. It is therefore the duty of every one
concerned with the public health to urge the extremest moderation in
the use of tea, coffee, tobacco, and alcoholic beverages, in the hope that
the injuries which have already been wrought may be avoided in the
future, and temperate indulgence take the place of unbridled consumption
until the day of final elimination arrives.</p>


<p class="center">SUMPTUARY LAWS.</p>

<p>In the interest, therefore, of the public health and the lengthening
of life and increasing the efficiency of man, we must bring ourselves to
the point of acknowledging that the State should control things which in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
themselves are injurious and unnecessary must be established. In other
words, the individual’s rights, so dear to every lover of freedom, the
cardinal principle of democracy, must give way to the public good. No
one has any right to practice any habit, or induce others to do so, which
in itself is likely to prove injurious to humanity. I would leave to the
individual the largest freedom in everything that is good, and restrict
his activities to the lowest minimum in everything that is bad. I would
not make of man a machine, nor would I desire that he should live in an
environment which in any way would tend to affect his evolution and
progress injuriously, and so I preach what seems to me the only solution
of all these evils—education, temperance, legal restriction of abuse, and
leave the rest to the manly part of humanity.</p>

<p>If I can in my life just put one nail in the coffin of quackery and
false medicine, I will not have lived in vain; if by my voice I can get
one man or woman interested in a healthy way of living, my work will
not be in vain; if I can save one infant from premature death, my life
will be well spent.</p>

<p>I believe when you conserve a man physically you conserve him
mentally and morally, and then sin and sorrow and suffering will pass.
There are only two learned professions in the world that are necessary—one
is agriculture and the other is teaching. If you feed men right and
teach them right, there will be no law breaking, and hence we will need
no lawyers; there will be no sickness, so we will need no physicians; and
when you have a country that is so happy as to have no law breakers or
sick people, you will not need anybody’s help to get you into heaven, so
we can do away with the ministers. (Laughter.)</p>


<p class="center">THE PROLONGATION OF LIFE.</p>

<p>What is in sight in the way of prolonging human life? I have
briefly laid down what seems to be the fundamental principles of the
conservation of man and the prevention of disease. If this plan can be
carried out, is there any hope to be offered to man of greater freedom
from disease and a longer life? I answer unhesitatingly in the affirmative.
Why should we be content with an average life of 44 years?
There is historical evidence to show that man’s greatest activities are
developed with experience and that the age between 60 and 70 is more
productive for one who has lived in accordance with nature. It is shown
from statistics that we die sixteen years before we reach the maximum
usefulness of man. I would like to see more old age. I would like to
see more men and women with gray hair and more wrinkled faces than
I can see today. To all this, objection may be made that a place must
be made for the young man and young woman; that the old man and
woman keep the young from development and usefulness. But to this
I reply, that there is infinite opportunity for good work offered to all.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
If we can secure a race free from disease, endowed with all those qualities
of mind and body which make for human efficiency, we need not
ask that every one become eminent and wealthy, but each can perform
the duties which come to him in a way to develop a uniform excellence
of the human race. We have room in the country for millions of people.
We welcome the infant and the child, but let us keep the man and
woman. There is room for all.</p>

<p>This is my message to you tonight—the conservation of man—not
only his health, but his life, the most precious possession man has. (Applause.)</p>


<p>Col. <span class="smcap">John I. Martin</span>—I move that the fullest acknowledgment and
thanks of this gathering be and are hereby tendered to Dr. Wiley for

<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—In the study of Conservation in this Congress
we are getting around to the fundamental basis of all vital conservation.
We are getting to the point where Conservation should have first begun—the
study of human life as a national asset. It was Pope who said
“The proper study of mankind is man.”</p>

<p>I take please in introducing to you, as the first speaker of this morning
session, one who has had a great deal to do in the actual figures, the
actual statistics, the actual knowledge of why human life is a national
asset and why it should be conserved. I take pleasure in introducing
to you Mr. E. E. Rittenhouse, of New York City, Conservation Commissioner
of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States,
whose subject is “Human Life as a National Asset.” (Applause.)</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Human Life as a National Asset”</span></h3>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rittenhouse</span>—The National Conservation Congress has been
engaged in the noble task of guarding posterity against the waste of our
natural resources by the present generation. It has had a most far-reaching
influence, for its purposes are in tune with public sentiment,
and with the spirit of the age. It has now given another and still more
commanding reason for its existence by joining earnestly in the campaign
for the conservation of our “human assets.” This is a field of
usefulness that will endure for all time. However important the protection
of our natural material resources may be, our greatest obligation
to posterity is to preserve the health, virility and morality of our
race.</p>

<p>The first and most important item in humanity’s Bill of Rights is
<em>the right to live</em>.</p>

<p>The primary purpose and function of organized society is to guard
the lives of its members from needless destruction. Liberty, education,
wealth and other earthly blessings are important—but we must be alive
to enjoy them.</p>

<p>The nation with the keenest sense of justice and the highest standard
of intelligence and morals—virtues which some of us modestly claim
for our people—is the one which should place the highest value upon
human life and surround it with the greatest protection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>How would our civilization rank by this method of measurement?
What have we already accomplished in preventing life waste? What
is our present loss? How can it be reduced?</p>

<p>We may well rejoice over the achievements of the patient heroes of
the laboratory and of the unselfish and devoted men of medicine who
have provided, disseminated and applied the knowledge of prevention
so far as it has gone. To them, to the press, the clergy, and the other
good men and women who have helped spread the gospel of disease prevention
belong the chief credit for the reduction of the death rate by
nearly 25 per cent. in the past thirty years.</p>

<p>To these benefactors of our race is also due the honor of initiating
and developing the widespread interest which now prevails throughout
our country in the conservation of health and life. They have demonstrated
that morbidity and mortality can be reduced—that human life
can be prolonged by spreading and applying our present knowledge of
the science of disease prevention. At the close of last year we had to
the credit of these life savers over 400,000 lives that would have been
lost that year if the death rate of 1880 had still prevailed.</p>

<p>If the present thirst for knowledge of health and life conservation
continues to increase, it is not only possible, it is reasonably certain that
during the next thirty years the present death rate of 15 per 1,000 population
in the registered area will be reduced to 10.</p>

<p>While we have every reason to felicitate ourselves upon this wonderful
result of the spread of life-saving intelligence, we must not overlook
these facts:</p>

<p>1. That this great life-saving movement is still in its infancy.</p>

<p>2. That it has been directed almost wholly against preventable contagious
diseases, and that the waste of life from these maladies has only
been reduced—the loss is still excessive.</p>

<p>3. That while we have reduced the mortality from these diseases
common to infancy and early adult life, the degeneration diseases of
middle life and old age, against which we have waged no war, have been
steadily increasing.</p>

<p>4. That we have increased the average length of human life only by
increasing the proportion of people living in the younger age periods,
while the average duration of life of those who pass into middle life and
old age has been constantly shortened.</p>

<p>In other words, we are still furiously burning the candle at both
ends—slower at one but faster at the other.</p>

<p>It is important that this point should be clearly understood. It is
natural to conclude at first glance that if we are saving these lives of the
younger age period that naturally there are more older people to die, but
that does not follow. In the first place, we are dealing with a death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
rate, the death rate for 1,000 population not in the bulk, and while it is
true that the passing of these lives over into the older age period does
affect that rate, it only affects it slightly. It has been asserted also that
the lives saved from these communicable diseases have been weakened
and that they die early after passing into middle life. It is also true
that that does not explain the extraordinary increase in the death rate
in the older age period. In England and Wales they have the same
reduction in the death rate of communicable diseases common to the
earlier age period, but not any increase above forty.</p>

<p>With all its blessings modern civilization has introduced hazards,
habits and conditions of life which may not only invite, but which have
increased in many ways, physical, mental and moral degeneracy.</p>

<p>What excuse have we Americans to offer for the excessive waste of
human efficiency and human life from which the Nation is now suffering?</p>

<p>Surely we can not plead ignorance nor poverty, for we have both the
knowledge and the money wherewith to stop this annual sacrifice.</p>

<p>How can we explain our growing contempt for the value and sacredness
of human life? There is no other civilized country where this
greatest of all assets—the most precious gift of the Almighty,—is held
so cheaply as in this glorious land of ours.</p>

<p>And why do we continue to view with indifference the constantly
multiplying evidences of the mental and physical degeneracy of our
race?</p>

<p>We may agree that in the long run the trend of humanity is ever
upward, and that this is but a temporary reaction, but can we afford to
rest wholly upon the hope that race deterioration will automatically
cease when our people have had time to adjust themselves to modern
conditions? Wise men doubt it. This problem will not solve itself;
this adverse tendency will be checked only when our people are made to
see conditions as they actually exist, and are aroused to the need of
correcting them.</p>

<p>This is our task. Let us briefly survey it.</p>

<p>In order to measure the effectiveness of the Nation’s life Conservation
work, and the magnitude of the task remaining undone, we must
now compare our efforts not with those of the past, nor with those of
other communities or countries, but with our present loss from preventable
and postponable sickness and mortality.</p>

<p>What are the principal items of life waste?</p>

<p>What evidence have we of degenerate tendencies? Here are some
of them—the estimates are from competent sources and are based upon
official records.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">
<p class="center">AN INDICTMENT.</p>

<p>Our birth rate is steadily declining, and at the same time the span of life is
steadily shortening.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven per cent. of our annual deaths are of babies under age 5;
200,000 of them die from preventable disease; about 150,000 of these are under
age 1.</p>

<p>To offset this waste of life, large families are demanded. Would it not be
well to stop this needless destruction of infants before asking for an increase in
the supply?</p>

<p>Of the 20,000,000 school children in this country not less than 75 per cent.
need attention for physical defects which are prejudicial to health.</p>

<p>Insanity and idiocy are increasing.</p>

<p>Diseases of vice, the most insidious enemy of this and future generations,
are spreading rapidly according to medical men. So far we have lacked the
moral courage to openly recognize and fight this scourge.</p>

<p>The alcohol and drug habits are constantly adding new victims to the degenerate
list and to the death roll.</p>

<p>Suicides are increasing and now reach the enormous total of about 15,000
annually.</p>

<p>Lynchings and burnings-at-the-stake continue, and are common only to our
country.</p>

<p>Attempts upon human life by individuals and mobs under trifling provocation,
or none at all, are obviously increasing.</p>

<p>Over 9,000 murders are committed every year, and it is estimated that but
an average of 116 murderers are executed for these crimes. We have the appalling
estimated homicide record of over 100 per million population as against 7 in
Canada, 9 in Great Britain and 15 in Italy.</p>

<p>In the United States the death rate above age 40 has increased steadily for
years (about 27 per cent. since 1880), while it has remained virtually stationary
in England and Wales.</p>

<p>The important organs of the body are wearing out too soon—the diseases of
old age are reaching down into the younger age periods.</p>

<p>The death rate from the degenerate diseases of the heart, blood vessels and
kidneys, including apoplexy, has increased over 100 per cent. since 1880. These
diseases claim over 350,000 lives annually.</p>

<p>The doctors tell us that fully 60 per cent. of these deaths are preventable or
postponable if the disease is discovered in time.</p>

<p>Periodical health examinations would detect these chronic diseases in time
to check or cure them, but aside from the efforts of the Equitable Life Assurance
Society and another smaller company, no public campaign to educate our people
to this vital need is being carried on.</p>

<p>All of our money, all of our energy, seem to be directed against diseases that
can be communicated. Is not a life lost from Bright’s disease as valuable as one
lost by typhoid fever?</p>

<p>The annual loss from pneumonia aggregates 135,000 lives, a large portion of
which is due to weakened bodily resistance resulting from these degenerative
affections.</p>

<p>Cancer, a baffling disease to which our people in their present physical condition
are highly susceptible, claims 75,000 lives annually and is increasing very
fast. Deaths from external cancer alone have increased 52 per cent. in ten years.</p>

<p>Pellagra, a deadly plague new to this country, is increasing rapidly in some
of our Southern States, and it excites but slight public concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>Over 150,000 Americans are destroyed annually by tuberculosis. We know
how to prevent it, but our taxpayers object to the expense and leave the battle
almost wholly to charity.</p>

<p>Nearly a million afflicted people are spreading the poison of tuberculosis to
the well, with virtually no official restraint or supervision because of the expense.</p>

<p>Over 25,000 Americans are still sacrificed annually to the preventable filth
disease—typhoid fever. About 300,000 suffer from it and are more or less impaired
by it.</p>

<p>Other germ diseases are wasting more lives than typhoid and tuberculosis
combined. We are warring against them, but compared to the lives still being
lost our efforts are feeble and only partially effective.</p>

<p>Over 90,000 Americans are killed annually by accidents and various forms
of violence. Our efforts to prevent the steady increase of this waste have failed.</p>

<p>The annual economic loss due to preventable disease and death is conservatively
estimated at $1,500,000,000, and our life loss at about $250,000,000.</p>

<p>To prevent fire waste our cities spend through the public service approximately
$1.65 per capita, and to prevent life waste, 33 cents per capita.</p>

<p>It is estimated that 1,500,000 of our people are constantly suffering from
preventable disease, and that during the next ten years American lives equaling
the population of the Pacific Coast and Rocky Mountain States (about 6,000,000)
will be needlessly destroyed if the present estimated mortality from preventable
and postponable disease continues.</p>
</div>

<p><em>These are the conditions we are asking our people to correct. Is
there anything unreasonable in the request?</em></p>

<p>The money loss is stupendous, but if this does not impress our
people, surely they should be stirred to action when they reflect upon
the immeasurable sum of sorrow, suffering, poverty, immorality, crime
and the hereditary degeneracy which results from this wholesale wrecking
and destruction of human life from preventable cause.</p>


<p class="center">RACE SUICIDE.</p>

<p>We are not only reducing the fertility of our race and also shortening
the span of life, but we are permitting at least 650,000 lives to be
destroyed annually which we could save by the application of simple
and well-known precautions.</p>

<p>This is the real race suicide problem.</p>

<p>If we would save these lives, they together with their natural offspring
would solve the problem of maintaining an adequate surplus of
births over deaths. What we need is not necessarily larger families, but
<em>more</em> families. A larger number of small families is surely preferable
to a smaller number of large families.</p>


<p class="center">THE DOLLAR AND THE DEATH RATE.</p>

<p>The primary duty of conserving our human assets resting with the
State, it is obvious that the State must lead in the national movement.
It is, therefore, the first duty of every individual and of every unofficial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
organization interested in this efficiency and life-saving campaign to
rally to the support of the public health service.</p>

<p>We must not only teach the individual how to guard his life against
preventable disease and accident, we must educate our communities to
the need of an effective public health service to enforce sanitary regulations
and otherwise guard the health and lives of their members.</p>

<p>But it takes money to carry on a great educational movement, and it
takes money to conduct the public health service.</p>

<p>The war against preventable disease and death is therefore in the
final analysis, a struggle between the dollar and the death rate.</p>

<p>So far the dollar is ahead. The body politic seems still to prefer a
high death rate to a slight and temporary increase in the tax rate.</p>

<p>“How much,” says the American taxpayer, “will it cost to reduce
this annoying death rate to the lowest possible limit?”</p>

<p>“About $1.50 per capita at first, much less later on,” answers the
health officer, “and you will gain immeasurably by the increase in the
wealth and happiness of the community.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” says the taxpayer, “here is 25 cents; we will save two
bits’ worth of these lives. The rest will have to die. We have much
more important places for our money; we must improve the streets and
roads, beautify our cities with much needed parks and public structures.
We must improve our harbors and rivers, build canals, and encourage
commerce generally. Besides, we are absolutely obliged to use about
two and a half billion dollars this year for automobiles, jewelry, candy,
alcoholic drinks, tobacco, diamonds and other similar urgent needs of
life. What is the loss of a few hundred thousand lives compared to
these vital necessities?”</p>

<p>And so the health officer plods along with his two-bit appropriation
and naturally runs a two-bit health service. His own fitness and efficiency
may be 100 per cent., but the effectiveness of his department
only 15 per cent. because of the 25-cent limit.</p>


<p class="center">TRIFLING WITH A SOLEMN DUTY.</p>

<p><em>National Government.</em>—Of all the money provided by the people for
the expenses of the National Government only about 1.3 per cent. is used
for the conservation of health and life.</p>

<p>Our national health corps has an international reputation for efficiency
and achievement. Although the service is under-manned and its
personnel underpaid, the patriotism and high sense of duty of these able
and energetic men have spurred them to the performance of the very
highest service to their country and to humanity. They have not only
jeopardized their lives, but numbers of them have sacrificed health and
life in the performance of duty.</p>

<p>Through their discoveries in the science of prevention, they have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
been the means of saving thousands of lives, not only for one year but
for all years to come. They have won the admiration of the American
people and deserve their most hearty support.</p>

<p>And yet, when it is proposed to co-ordinate the various public health
activities of the Government in order to increase the efficiency and usefulness
of this splendid body of men, the interest of our countrymen in
this service seems to end with admiration. For notwithstanding our
confidence and appreciation we have permitted a small but active body
of people who are more concerned in treating disease than in preventing
it to block the consummation of this thoroughly sensible and business-like
consolidation of the various bureaus under one responsible head.</p>

<p>We have many educational agencies at work throughout the country
which are directly or indirectly arousing public interest in health conservation,
but this experience emphasizes the need for a permanent central
organization to stimulate interested people to back up their judgment
with action, and no organization is better fitted to render this
invaluable service than this National Conservation Congress.</p>

<p>At the last session of this Congress Dr. Harvey Wiley told you
something about the dangers of impure food, drink and drugs, and
what was being done to guard the public against them. Your individual
interest was excited. How long did it continue? Were any of you inspired
to give actual support and assistance in the enforcement of the
pure food laws or to any other official public health activity? To be interested
and to agree is not enough—again, we must act, individually as
well as collectively, and stimulate others to act.</p>

<p><em>States.</em>—The same lack of practical support of the public life-saving
service exists in most of the States. The appropriations for the public
health work of our State departments can only be characterized as
trifling. The exception is Pennsylvania, which is paving the way for a
fully adequate health service, as was explained to you at the third session
of this Congress in the able paper of Mr. A. B. Farquhar.</p>

<p>The appropriation for the Pennsylvania State Health Department
is about 48 cents per capita. Arkansas makes none at all, the State of
New York spends about 1.7 cents; Massachusetts, 4.2; Florida, 10; Indiana,
1.8; Kansas, 2.7; Virginia, 1.9, and so on.</p>

<p><em>Municipalities.</em>—We have many cities with active and efficient health
officers, but there is not a city in this country with an adequately
equipped and financed health department. Not one of them has sufficient
financial support to successfully perform its task, which must be
measured by the preventable sick and death list in each community.
And we must not confine this list to contagious affections. It must include
an educational campaign against all preventable diseases.</p>

<p>The duty of the State to teach our people, through the health departments,
how to avoid preventable disease of all kinds that they may live<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
healthful and productive lives, is just as imperative as is the duty of
teaching them, through our schools, how to avoid illiteracy and how to
live intelligent and useful lives.</p>

<p>While health appropriations have increased over former years, all
of our cities place the value of property far above that of human life in
applying measures to prevent waste. Here are a few examples:</p>

<p>In 1911, fifty of our important American cities, with an annual
preventable death list of 117,724 people (which means an economic loss
of at least $200,000,000) spent through their public service to prevent
life waste, an average of 30 cents per capita, and through their fire departments
to prevent fire waste, $1.63 per capita.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples: Providence, R. I., spent for health conservation,
11 cents; for fire prevention, $1.99 per capita; Portland, Ore.,
health, 13 cents; fire, $1.91; Minneapolis, health, 14 cents; fire, $1.67;
Louisville, health, 12 cents; fire, $1.36.</p>

<p>In 1910, 184 American cities could spare but two per cent. of their
total public appropriations for the public health service. The average
for all expenses was $16.54 per capita. Of this but 33 cents was for the
public health. Seventy-one of these 184 cities spent less than 15 cents per
capita for the public health, and among these are such cities as Quincy,
Ill., 2 cents; Lansing, Mich., 5 cents; Rockford, Ill., 6 cents; Scranton,
Pa., 7 cents; Bridgeport, Conn., 9 cents; Portland, Ore., 10 cents; Harrisburg,
Pa., 12 cents; Jersey City, N. J., 13 cents; Springfield, Ill., 14
cents.</p>

<p>There are many of our largest cities that are well below the average
of 33 cents per capita. Among them: Toledo, 15 cents; St. Paul, 17
cents; Minneapolis, 18 cents; Indianapolis, 20 cents; Kansas City, Mo.,
20 cents; Milwaukee, 20 cents; Cincinnati, 21 cents; Chicago, 22 cents;
St. Louis, Mo., 26 cents; Buffalo, 27 cents; San Francisco, 28 cents.</p>

<p>The natural result of this sort of economy is that the health laws
we have are not properly enforced.</p>

<p>How can we benefit from the pure food laws, for example, while we
refuse to provide the means of enforcing them?</p>

<p>The great city of New York has an ably administered health department,
but it has only thirty inspectors to supervise over 27,000 food
dispensing establishments. The request of the health officer for an inspection
force of 209 men has been steadily ignored for years.</p>

<p>How do you suppose the meat ordinances of Philadelphia are enforced
where the people allow the health department but seven inspectors
to watch over 8,000 meat shops and slaughter houses?</p>

<p>How can the eight pure food inspectors in Kansas be expected to
enforce the pure food laws in the drug and grocery stores, the meat
shops, bakeries, etc., in 800 towns? These inspections must be made
frequently to be of any value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>These are not exceptions, they are examples.</p>

<p>Could anything be more absurd from a business point of view than
this record of “economy” in providing for the public life-saving service?</p>


<p class="center">HOW SOME COMMUNITIES SAVE MONEY.</p>

<p>Some prosperous American communities hold human life so cheaply
that they maintain no public health service at all. Others—and there
are many of them—have a mere skeleton service. The citizens imagine
that if they appoint a health board consisting of doctors, all will be well
with them. The suggestion that the board be provided with money to
carry on its functions would be regarded as wanton extravagance.</p>

<p>There are scores of cities and towns which select a doctor to head
the health department and expect him to earn his living by practicing
his profession among the very people over whom he is supposed to exercise
police authority in enforcing sanitary and other health regulations.</p>

<p>There are cities of from 5,000 to 100,000 population that hire a
doctor on the “part time” plan as chief health officer, and pay him a
trifling salary. Whether he is a competent sanitarian or in any way
skilled in the prevention of disease is a matter of little concern to them.
The fact that they are saving a few dollars in his salary fills them with
joy and indifference as to the consequences to the community.</p>

<p>I know of a thriving, wealthy young city in the South of 130,000
population with a substantial preventable death rate which saves as
much as $800 annually in this way.</p>

<p>I know of a prosperous New England city of 40,000 population with
but three people in its health department—two of them are “part time”
employes. It is a six cents per capita department <em>and 50 per cent. of
the annual deaths in that city are of children under five years of age</em>.</p>

<p>In theory, we must all stand ready to serve the State when called
upon, even at personal loss. But does it not seem the height of absurdity
to expect a competent professional man to leave his practice to
take charge of these under-manned and under-financed health departments
at the small salaries which our States and cities offer them? If
he does his duty, he is sure to make enemies during his term of service,
and if he is an able man he will certainly lose money by leaving his
practice.</p>

<p>Surely we offer our health officers every inducement to follow the line
of least resistance.</p>


<p class="center">A SAMPLE GROUP OF CITIES.</p>

<p>An investigation was recently made of forty-four Illinois cities averaging
in population about 16,000; fifteen of them had over 20,000 population,
and three had over 50,000.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The average salaries paid the chief health officer amounted to the magnificent
sum of $300 annually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>

<p>Twelve of these cities paid nothing for health protection—and this included
three cities of 22,000 population and one of 30,000 population.</p>

<p>One city of 26,000 population employed a layman as a health officer.</p>

<p>In one of 22,000 the police matron served as “health officer” when she was
not otherwise engaged.</p>

<p>Twenty-nine of these cities made no pretense of supervising their milk
supply.</p>

<p>Only nine of them had isolation hospitals for contagious diseases.</p>

<p>Thirty-one of them kept no mortuary records whatever.</p>
</div>

<p>These conditions exist in a prosperous agricultural and manufacturing
State—and they can doubtless be found to exist in almost any State
in the Union.</p>


<p class="center">AGENCIES THAT CAN HELP.</p>

<p>These are unpleasant facts, but they give us an idea of the way we
are performing the primary function of government—the guarding of
human life against avoidable destruction.</p>

<p>We have now briefly considered the extent of the waste of the most
vital asset of the nation, and how we are conserving it, or rather how
we are not conserving it.</p>

<p>Now let us rejoice over the fact that we not only know how to reduce
this waste, but that thanks to those who have aroused the life conservation
sentiment in this country, a general improvement in the public
health service is taking place in many States and cities. The experiment
has been successful. We now know what we can do. We have
the wealth and knowledge, and the machinery is organized throughout
the country to rapidly correct our appalling record of life waste. Our
work is to induce our people to use it.</p>

<p>Every business and social organization should do its full share of this
work.</p>

<p>The life insurance institutions of this country have a constituency of
25,000,000 policyholders. These policyholders are directly interested in
the promotion of longevity, not only from the humanitarian but from
the financial viewpoint; for the lower the mortality among policyholders,
the greater will be the saving and the larger the dividends to policyholders,
which means a reduction in the cost of their life insurance. It
is estimated that about $50,000,000 is lost annually by postponable mortality
among the insured.</p>

<p>The Equitable Life Assurance Society, with which I have the honor
to be connected, is endeavoring to do its part not only in conserving the
lives of its policyholders, but in stimulating community action. The
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company of New York is also rendering a
valuable public service in Conservation along somewhat different lines.
Two or three of the small companies, and perhaps the same number of
fraternal insurance societies, have also given it attention. Let us hope
that the time is near at hand when the other two hundred-odd life insurance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
companies, and the fraternal societies as well, will also increase
their usefulness to their policyholders and the public by joining in this
great work.</p>


<p class="center">SOME SUGGESTIONS.</p>

<p>This Congress will be asked to do and to advocate many things, for
there are a multitude of independent activities connected directly or
indirectly with this general subject. Among others I sincerely trust the
following suggestions will be duly considered:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>1. To encourage business institutions, civic, social and religious organizations
which have influence over any considerable number of people to join in at
least some of the many phases of the life conservation campaign.</p>

<p>2. To encourage the education of the individual to adopt healthful habits
of life—to avoid the intemperate life, which means excess in eating, drinking,
working, playing—and unhealthful indulgence in indolence as well.</p>

<p>3. To encourage communities to establish and maintain ample public health
organizations consistent with the magnitude of the work in hand.</p>

<p>4. To advocate the organization of local health leagues as a stimulus to
public interest and to give aid and support to the public health service.</p>

<p>5. To encourage the slowly growing sentiment for a rigid supervision (and
isolation if necessary) of tubercular victims, which is the only way in which
this devastating plague can be stamped out.</p>

<p>6. To advocate the employment of civic nurses in the health service, who
may also act as health inspectors and aid in educational work.</p>

<p>7. To advocate the issuance and distribution by the States or municipalities
of an official prevention manual to teach the public how to avoid preventable
disease.</p>

<p>8. To urge every individual to go to his or her doctor for periodical health
inspections to detect disease in time to arrest or cure it.</p>

<p>9. To urge employers of labor to give their employes these examinations
free as a part of their efficiency and welfare program.</p>

<p>10. To encourage philanthropy, now so generously contributing for the care
of the sick, to also enter the field of disease prevention which it has so far quite
generally neglected.</p>
</div>

<p>Human life is our paramount asset. Its conservation should be your
paramount issue.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The audience is certainly indebted for this great
and interesting paper. It is hard to get over stubborn facts and figures,
especially where figures are facts.</p>

<p>A great doctor once shocked the people of the country by saying that
everybody should be chloroformed when they arrived at the age of sixty.
From this paper it would seem we ought at least to reach the age of
sixty, the age of being chloroformed, and, better still, we had better so
conduct the board of health and so support liberally the board of health
in our city that people may just begin to live when they get to be sixty.</p>

<p>I now have the pleasure of introducing Prof. Irving Fisher, of Yale
University, who has given this subject many years of study and research<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
and will now speak to you upon the “Public Health Movement.” (Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Public Health Movement”</span></h3>
<p>Prof. <span class="smcap">Fisher</span>—The Conservation movement is a movement to prevent
waste. When the Conservation Commission was appointed, four years
ago, emphasis was placed on the wastes of our natural resources, but by
the time the Commission made its report, it had come to the conclusion
that by far the most serious as well as the most preventable wastes are
the wastes of human life.</p>

<p>A generation ago it was a common impression that the average
human lifetime was fixed as by a decree of fate. When I was in college
one of our reverend instructors showed us a mortality table and said
with great impressiveness: “There is no law more hard and fast than
the law of mortality.” I believed it, and even yet many people are
under this delusion. Pasteur did much to introduce a more optimistic
view. He stated his belief in these immortal words, “It is within the
power of man to rid himself of every parasitic disease.” He staked this
opinion on his own wonderful laboratory revelations as to germ life.
Today we can confirm his words by absolute statistics. And now his
successor, Metchnikoff, has surpassed even Pasteur in optimism. Metchnikoff
is devoting himself to the question of the prolongation of human
life and already gives us a vision of the time when centenarians will be
regarded merely as in the prime of life and when the normal span of a
century and a quarter will be a frequent occurrence.</p>

<p>The growing consciousness that human life is not a fixed allotment,
which we must accept as our doom, but a variable, which is within our
power to control, has recently led to extraordinary exertions all over
the world to save human life. This impulse has gained strength also
from the great and almost universal decline in the birth rate. Old
countries like France, and new countries like Australia, are confronted
with the specter of depopulation. Consequently, as human life becomes
scarce, it becomes precious—like any other commodity! These two
facts, the consciousness that much mortality is preventable, or at any
rate postponable and the fact that increasingly fewer babies are being
born in the world, are together operating to produce a great health
movement throughout the world. Nothing will stop it until the whole
world is convinced of the paramount importance of this problem of
human Conservation.</p>

<p>This world-wide movement for the conservation of human life has expressed
itself in many ways—in medical research; in societies for preventing
tuberculosis, infant mortality, social diseases, alcoholism, and vice;
in the growth of sanatoria, dispensaries, hospitals and other institutions;
in an immense output of hygienic literature, not only technical books
and journals, but also popular articles in the magazines and daily news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
papers; in the constant agitation and legislation for purer foods, milk
supply, meat supply and water supply; in the movement to limit the
labor of women and children and to improve factory sanitation; in the
establishment of social insurance in Germany, England, Denmark and
other countries; in the improvement of departments of health; in the
spread of gymnastics, physical training and school hygiene; in the revival
of the Olympic games and the effort to revive the old Greek ideals
of physical perfection and beauty, and last, and most important, in the
sudden development of the science of eugenics.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1911 was held in Dresden a unique world’s fair,
devoted exclusively to health—the International Hygiene Exhibition.
In this were shown the fruits of the whole movement in all lands—except,
alas, our own; for to our shame it must be said that we, as yet, are
among the backward nations in this movement for the conservation of
human life. Our Congress was asked to appropriate $60,000 to erect a
building and supply an exhibit to show what we have done for our part
in this movement, but Congress thought it could not afford so large an
expenditure for so small (!) an object, and the result was that from the
millions of people who visited this exhibition one constantly heard the
question asked: “Where is the United States?”</p>

<p>And those few Americans who did go to visit the exhibition found
that other nations had far outstripped us in this movement for national
sanitation and health. Some of the achievements already attained by
other nations should be recorded among the wonders of the world. One
is the striking decline of the death rate in the city of London. Within
two decades, London’s death rate has virtually been cut in two and is
now only thirteen per thousand, or less than that of most cities one-fiftieth
its size.</p>

<p>Probably, however, the greatest achievement of any country is that
of Sweden, where the duration of life is the longest, the mortality the
least and the improvements the most general. There alone can it be
said that the chances of life have been improved for all ages of life. Infancy,
middle age and old age today show a lower mortality in Sweden
than in times past, while in other countries, including the United States,
although we can boast of some reduction in infant mortality, the mortality
after middle age is growing worse and the innate vitality of the
people is, in all probability, deteriorating. The reason why Sweden of
all countries has succeeded in improving the vitality of middle age and
old age, while other nations have failed, is, I believe, to be found in the
fact that Sweden, of all nations, has seen the problem of human hygiene
as a whole instead of partially. In most other lands, and particularly
in the United States, public health has been regarded almost exclusively
as a matter of protection against germs; but protection against germs,
while effective in defending us from plague and other epidemics of acute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
diseases, is almost powerless to prevent the chronic diseases of middle
and late life. These maladies—Bright’s disease, heart disease, nervous
breakdowns—are due primarily to unhygienic personal habits. Medical
inspection and instruction in schools, as well as Swedish gymnastics,
have aided greatly in the muscular development of the citizens of Sweden.
Swedish hard bread has preserved their teeth. The Gothenburg
system is gradually weaning them from alcohol. There has even been a
strong movement against the use of tobacco. Other countries are tardily
following in the path which Sweden has trod so successfully.</p>

<p>The significant fact is that Sweden has not hesitated to attack the
problems of personal habits. I believe we must have a revolution in the
habits of living in the community if we are going really to realize the
promise of Metchnikoff and others as to the prolongation of human life.
Health officers in this country have not regarded it as a part of their
duty either to live personally a clean, hygienic life, or to teach others to
do so, or even to investigate what those conditions of well-being are
which make for personal vitality.</p>

<p>I can remember, thirteen years ago, talking with a doctor in Colorado
as to the habits of living of his patients. I said to him, “You tell
me that tuberculosis is a house disease, and that the reason it exists is
because people do not open their windows. Why, then, do you not tell
your patients they must open their windows, or sleep out of doors?”
He said, “I wouldn’t dare to do that; I would lose my practice. They
would think I was a crank and meddling in their personal affairs.”
Today that battle has been largely won. Today, not only in Colorado
and California, and in the places where there is perpetual sunshine,
sleeping out of doors is common and not confined to invalids, but indulged
in by the community generally. Even in New England and
throughout the country you will find sleeping balconies going up all
over. The change has even affected in some degree the architecture of
the country, and while as yet only a minority of the people sleep out of
doors, yet I believe it is true that the majority of the people in the
United States have far more air in their sleeping and living rooms
today than ten years ago. The fact which the doctor in Colorado did
not dare tell his patients thirteen years ago, has in some way been told
to the people of the United States.</p>

<p>But there are many other things that need to be told, after we
are sure that they are true. When we have, through our National,
State or municipal officers made thorough investigation and have been
able to discover the actual truth as regards eating and drinking, hours
of work, recreation and play—all those facts that go into what may
be called personal habits, then we may gradually overturn existing
unhygienic habits of living. John Burns attributes a large part of the
great reduction in London mortality to the improved personal habits of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
working men, particularly in regard to alcohol. In this country, Dr.
Evans, both as health officer of Chicago and later as health editor
of a Chicago newspaper, has shown how public instruction in personal
habits can be made effective, and it will be largely through affecting
personal habits that the life insurance companies will improve the
longevity of their policy holders.</p>

<p>Scientific men today have reached substantial agreement that alcohol
is a poison. When everybody understands this, the days of alcohol as
a beverage will be numbered. Sweden in the thirties was called drunken
Sweden, but today the antialcohol movement there has converted Sweden
into one of the soberest of countries.</p>

<p>But the use of tobacco, tea and coffee ought also to be investigated,
so that we may know how far they are deleterious, and to spread this
knowledge among the people.</p>

<p>Fashions are in their essence changeable and the time will come
when the world will not be built on fashion but on reason. Japan has
made more rapid progress in civilization than any other nation, because
the late Mikado resolved and publicly stated that the institutions of
Japan must not be tied by tradition but must be based on reason. When
we have replaced tradition by reason, we shall have gotten a solid
basis for civilization, and this must apply to ancient customs and habits
of every kind. I am firmly convinced that we are looking at only one-half
of this public health movement as long as we confine ourselves
to the acute or infectious diseases. We shall not get more than half the
results obtainable until we realize that there must be a revolution in the
personal habits of the people.</p>

<p>Yet the United States, in spite of its shortcomings, has some special
triumphs to record. We have, through hygiene under Colonel Gorgas,
made it possible to dig the Panama Canal. We have virtually abolished
yellow fever on our shores and in Cuba. We have nearly eliminated
hook worm disease in Porto Rico and are gradually doing the
same in the Southern States. We have found a cure for spinal meningitis.
We have, in New York, made an object lesson in the last year of
reducing the summer death rate of infants in a striking manner. We
have, by individual milk stations in Boston and other cities and in
individual sanatoria, dispensaries and other institutions, demonstrated
that the death rate from specific diseases can often be cut in two.</p>

<p>Yet we have depended altogether too much on private initiative. In
New York the summer death rate of infants was reduced chiefly through
the work of the milk committee and individuals like Nathan Straus. The
elimination of hook worm disease and the discovery of the cure of
spinal meningitis came through the gifts of Mr. Rockefeller. It is well
that individuals should apply themselves to these problems and without
such personal interest they could never be solved. Nevertheless, progress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
will be many times as rapid when the problems for the nation are managed
in a national way. There are three great agencies to which we
must look for the saving of human life in the future and it has been the
object of the Committee of One Hundred on National Health, of which
I am President, to help stir these three agencies into activity in this
country. They are the public press, the insurance companies and the
Government.</p>

<p>To a limited extent, all of these agencies have increased their health
activities in recent years. A few years ago, popular articles on public
health were seldom seen because the public and the press thought the
subject of disease uninteresting and repulsive. Today, on the other
hand, one can scarcely pick up a popular magazine without finding not
only one but several articles dealing with questions of public health;
and it has been found possible not only to make these articles interesting,
but, by emphasizing the positive, or health side, instead of the
negative, or disease side, to render them attractive and beautiful. And
yet, as Dr. Wiley has said, the newspapers in spite of all the good they
are doing with their right hands are, with their left hands, in their
advertising columns trying to undo that good by advertising the fraudulent
part of the “healing” profession who are trying to line their own
pockets at the expense of the lives of the public.</p>

<p>The second great agency from which I believe we may expect wonderful
results in the future is life insurance. As our committee pointed
out to the Association of Life Insurance Presidents several years ago,
life insurance companies can save money by preventing deaths just as
fire insurance companies have saved money by preventing fires, and
steam boiler insurance companies have saved money by preventing explosions.
Since this suggestion was made, a number of progressive
life insurance companies have tried the experiment. The Metropolitan
and the Equitable have established departments of human conservation
and a number of other and smaller companies have undertaken similar
enterprises. The Postal Life Insurance Company has recently published
the statistical results of their experience, worked out in a most careful
manner, and have demonstrated absolutely that it pays life insurance
companies to save human life. This being the case, we may expect life
insurance companies in the future to become active in life conservation.
Already there are probably fifteen million policy holders in the United
States insured in companies which are trying to do something for their
health—through medical examinations, instruction in hygiene, utilization
of visiting nurses, participation in civic health movements and
otherwise. To save human life merely to save money is sordid enough,
but it is well to harness commercial motives, when possible, in the service
of humanity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>The third, and most important, agency is the government. State and
National health offices are becoming yearly stronger and more efficient;
and yet much remains to be done, particularly by the National Government.
We need a National Department of Health or a Department
of Labor which shall include in its operations the conservation of
human life. We have already passed the phosphorus match bill to prevent
one of the worst industrial diseases—phossy jaw. We have passed
effective legislation in regard to interstate commerce in prostitution.
We have established a Children’s Bureau and a Bureau of Mines to
prevent industrial accidents in mining. We have enacted suitable legislation
in regard to cocaine and habit-forming drugs. We have a Pure
Food Law and laws for the inspection of meats. Yet, as Dr. Wiley,
Mrs. Crane and others who have watched the operation of these laws at
close range well know, they need to be executed with a stronger hand.</p>

<p>The truth is that as yet we have only made a feeble beginning in
public health work, especially in this country. We need first of all to
do what Sweden has done for a hundred and fifty years—namely, to
keep proper vital statistics. Vital statistics are the bookkeeping of
health, and we cannot economize health any more successfully than we
can economize money unless we keep books. At present only a little
over half of the population of the United States has statistics of its
deaths, while the statistics of the births are as yet nowhere sufficiently
accurate to be called real statistics.</p>

<p>Our National Statistician, Dr. Wilbur, illustrates by a story how
much better we keep our commercial books than our books of vital statistics.
In a Western State a girl was entitled to a fortune when she
became twenty-one. Reaching, as she supposed, her twenty-first birthday,
she laid claim to the fortune. Much to her surprise, her father
said, “But you are only nineteen;” and then the two tried to look
up the records. They had no family Bible, they had no public record
office to go to, and they were at sea as to how to discover exactly the
date when she was born. However it suddenly occurred to her father,
who was a farmer, that the very day his daughter was born a calf was
born on his farm and the birth of the calf had been recorded. In that
way he established the date of the birth of his daughter.</p>

<p>In view of the great slack of our vital statistics, therefore, we
cannot measure even the death rate, much less the number of preventable
deaths in the United States. All that we can do is to study carefully
the registration area and on this basis to work out certain minimum
figures.</p>

<p>Four years ago, as a member of President Roosevelt’s Conservation
Commission, I endeavored to do this and to report on the condition of
our “National Vitality.” I found, after getting together all the statistics
available and taking account of the degree of preventability of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
different diseases as estimated by experts that, out of some 1,500,000
deaths annually in the United States, at least 630,000 are preventable.
Of these preventable deaths, the greater number are from seven causes.
These seven causes include three great diseases of infancy, then typhoid
fever, which usually makes its attack in the twenties, then tuberculosis,
accidents in industry, and pneumonia which come in the thirties.</p>

<p>Now 630,000 unnecessary deaths per year mean over 1,700 unnecessary
deaths per day or more than the lives lost on the Titanic disaster. The
nation cannot continue indifferent to hygiene as it gradually dawns
on the public that for lack of hygiene we suffer a Titanic disaster
every day of the year. The popular imagination was deeply stirred by
the image of 1,600 helpless human beings suddenly engulfed in mid-ocean.
That was a vivid dramatic picture which the blindest of men
could see and understand. It led to immediate official action on both
sides of the Atlantic to safeguard human life at sea. Yet on land we
lose three hundred and sixty-five times as many lives as this every year
and never stop to add it up. They are scattered and diffused throughout
the land—a Wilbur Wright lost from typhoid, a handful of miners
in an explosion, some railway employes in an accident, some victims of
lead poisoning, a little army of infants, here a few and there a few.
Yet these deaths are just as real and mean an infinitely more serious
loss than were the deaths from the Titanic disaster. Moreover, they
could be as easily prevented.</p>

<p>And concomitant with this unnecessarily great death rate, there
is, of course, a colossal aggregate of needless sickness. We have no
real statistics, but by analogy with English statistics we may assume
that, on the average, for every death per annum there are two persons
sick during the year. This makes about three million people constantly
lying on sick beds in the United States, of which, on the most conservative
estimate, at least half do not need to have been there.</p>

<p>If, now, on the basis of these figures, we try to compute how much
human life is needlessly shortened in the United States, we find that
it is shortened at least fifteen years. Again, if we translate these preventable
losses into commercial terms, we find that, even by the most
conservative reckoning, this country is losing over $1,500,000,000 worth
of wealth producing power every year.</p>

<p>What does this mean? To us individually, it means that we are
losing a large part of our rightful life not only by death itself which
cuts off many years we might have lived, but also from diseases and
disabilities which are not fatal but cripple the power to work and mar
the joy of living. I believe I am far within the facts when I venture
the opinion that the average man or woman in the United States is not
doing half of the work nor having half of the joy of work of which the
human being is capable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>With all this room for improvement before our eyes, it is not surprising
that the zeal of the health movement is growing fast. Each success
serves as justification for further effort.</p>

<p>One of the most encouraging symptoms of progress is the great attention
which is being paid to public health in the present political campaign.
All three of the party platforms included planks in behalf
of public health. The Democratic and Progressive platforms were particularly
explicit and emphatic and all the candidates have emphasized
health in speeches and in their record in public life. The Democratic
campaign managers are carrying out plans to make progressive health
legislation prominent in the campaign.</p>

<p>These and other indications augur well for better legislation, more
energetic enforcement of the law and, above all, a more appreciative
public sentiment as to the transcendent importance of the conservation
of human life. It is now reported that the Hon. Dr. Roche, Secretary of
State in Canada, is in strong sympathy with the proposal there for the
establishment of a Federal Department of Health and the Republic of
China is reported to have already established such a department.</p>

<p>From all these indications of actual activity as well as from the
logic of the situation we are justified in predicting that an age of
human conservation is at hand. Men and women are waking to their
responsibility to the race. Eugenics will be a watchword of the future.
To squander our natural resources is ignoble indeed, but far worse
is it to squander our vital resources. The most sacred obligation of
each generation is to bequeath its life capital unimpaired to the generation
which comes after. Scourges like typhoid and tuberculosis must
be swept off the face of the earth. Habit-forming drugs, including
alcohol (and even tobacco, especially for young boys) must be recognized
in their true light as means of depleting the vitality of nations.
Prostitution and the white slave traffic must be condemned anew as
robbers of the race. Industries which kill and maim, poison or infect
their workers, which deform and stunt little children, which incapacitate
women for normal motherhood, which through overlong hours of toil
close each successive day’s work with progressive exhaustion, must be
controlled. Machinery was made for man, not man for machinery. Immigration
which drains European public institutions of their criminal,
insane, feeble-minded and other defectives and delinquents and sets
these creatures loose in America to breed with and contaminate our
population, must be regulated. Marriage laws and customs must be
adjusted so as to discourage or forbid the procreation by the unfit. All
these and other hygienic and eugenic reforms will be realized as fast
as public sentiment becomes educated to the solemn responsibilities and
higher valuations of human life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>The noblest task, therefore, which I can conceive for any man is
to aid in erecting true ideals of perfect manhood and womanhood. Our
ideals, though improving, are not yet worthy to be compared with those
of Japan or Sweden and the ideals even of these countries have not yet
reached the level of those of ancient Greece still imaged for us in imperishable
marble. With superior knowledge our health ideals should
excel those of any other age. These ideals should not stop with the
mere negation of disease, degeneracy, delinquency and dependency.
They should be positive and progressive. They should include muscular
development, a sound mind in a sound body, integrity of moral fiber, a
sense of the splendor of the perfect human body as a temple of the
human soul, a sense of the enjoyment of all life’s proper functions.
As William James said, simply to breathe or move our muscles should be
a delight. The thoroughly healthy person is full of joy and optimism.
He rejoiceth like a strong man to run a race. Said Emerson, “Give me
health and a day and I will make the pomp of emperors ridiculous.”
Our health ideals should be nothing short of an abiding sense of the
sweetness and beauty, the nobility and holiness, of human life.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Announcement by the President</span></h3>
<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—We have had wonderful addresses this morning
from the distinguished speakers upon this question of conservation of
human life.</p>

<p>I wish now to announce the Committee on Credentials: Mr. E. T.
Allen of Portland, Ore., Mr. Volney T. Foster of Chicago, and Col.
W. A. Fleming Jones of Las Cruces, N. M.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Committee on Resolutions</span></h3>
<p>I wish also to announce the Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions:
Mr. Walter H. Page of New York. The different State organizations
will report to him a member for that committee from each particular
State. It will be well to report to Mr. Page either tonight or
early in the morning.</p>

<p>We all need to be put under authority. We find people are not
taking good care of their health, of themselves or of the community.
We will now hear from Dr. L. E. Cofer of Washington, D. C., Assistant
Surgeon-General of the United States Public Health Service, who will
address the Congress on the subject of “Authority In Health Control.”</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Authority in Health Control”</span></h3>
<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Cofer</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I do not think
any invitation has ever been received with more satisfaction than the
one for a representative of our service to appear before you. It was
received with the greatest gratification.</p>

<p>The Public Health Service is absorbed in the work of health conservation
and Surgeon-General Blue evinced the greatest interest in
your invitation for him to send a representative to explain the scope
of the work being performed and discuss the question of authority in
connection therewith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>This topic is now receiving the consideration of many authorities
on public health matters, and on this account one may approach the
subject in a hopeful attitude. I say “hopeful” because public health
as an institution is rapidly growing, and its practical value is becoming
more and more manifest, and sanitary science is not now nearly so
far in advance of its practical application as it was even a few years
ago. The possibilities of sanitation in the general advancement are
being made a part of all high ideals of government, so that it is not
to be wondered at that the general government should be called upon to
do its share. The difficulty lies in determining just what the government
should do in aid of public health and just what should be left to the
States and municipalities.</p>

<p>History furnishes no precedents for this Nation to follow. It is
almost useless to seek a model for our guidance in some foreign country.
A nation with our conditions of boundary and magnitude, with millions
of immigrants coming to our shores from all parts of the earth, has its
own salvation to work out in the public health as well as in many other
problems. In other words, we must rely upon ourselves, whether we
proceed in haste or by feeling our way step by step. There is a marked
divergence of sentiment growing in regard to national health control.
One is that the government should do far more than it is now doing
towards the protection of the public health, another that too much is
expected of the National Government, and that there is a tendency on
the part of State governments to call upon the Federal Government
for service which should be performed by the States themselves, but
which service is asked for largely in the interest of economy. These
widely differing ideas in regard to the apportionment of public health
responsibility lead us to a consideration of the provisions of the Constitution
of the United States relative to this matter. These provisions
are contained in Section VIII, paragraphs I and 3:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Section VIII. The Congress shall have power—</p>

<p>Par. 1. To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay
the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of
the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform
throughout the United States.</p>

<p>Par. 3. To regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the
several States, and with the Indian tribes.</p>
</div>

<p>It has been held by some that the powers of the National Government,
relating to public health, are restricted to paragraph 3, which
gives the right to Congress to regulate commerce, and, in regulating
commerce, to so regulate it as to prevent its being a carrier of disease.
Others have held that under the general welfare clause, in paragraph 1,
Congress has the right to legislate for the public health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>Should the latter interpretation be the correct one, Congress could
establish the national health control over States and municipalities with
regard to municipal and domestic sanitation, with all details as to house
drainage, plumbing, sewerage, and disposal of garbage, water supply,
ventilation, school houses and public buildings ventilation, examination
of milk supply, food and drugs, disposal of the dead, disinfection of
dwellings, etc. Would it be desirable for the National Government to
have such authority? Would it be tolerated by the people? It is a fact
that the American people have already decided this question when the
old National Board of Health was abolished.</p>

<p>The National Board of Health was created by an act of Congress,
approved March 3, 1879. Another act was approved June 2, 1879,
clothing the board with certain quarantine powers, but this last act
was limited to a period of four years, at the expiration of which time
Congress declined to renew it. The National Board of Health, therefore,
had an active existence from 1879 to 1883. The act establishing the
board remained upon the statute books until February 15, 1893, when it
was formally repealed by Congress.</p>

<p>To state the case concisely, the National Board of Health was not
in accord with the spirit of American government, and the people rejected
it. Now, what do the American people want? I will not attempt
to answer this question, but will suggest that they want a general
sanitary administration which is capable of steady development, and yet
may be subject to such modifications as the changing conditions of our
country may necessitate, a sanitary policy which can be made to expand
until it will answer the public needs not only for the present but even
for decades to come.</p>

<p>Its direct aim should be the ultimate intelligence and education of
the average citizen in matters relating to his personal health, and the
health of his commonwealth. No better plan for sanitary government
appears at the present time than one modeled upon the structure of the
general government itself. Broadly stated, this sanitary policy expects
of each State a sanitary autonomy whose influence should be appreciated
by every individual in every hamlet, however small, in its domain. It
contemplates a State pride in the development of sanitation, a self-reliance
and an unwillingness to surrender functions or call for aid
from the general government excepting after the clearest convictions of
propriety or necessity. This policy expects from the general government
that since it controls commerce, both maritime and interstate,
it will prevent commerce from conveying disease; that it will respect the
sanitary institutions of the States; that it will have such organizations
and establishments as properly belong to its sphere of action to supplement
where States fail, and to enable it to wield its peculiar power when
urgency demands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>As an apt illustration of this conception of authority in health control,
let us consider the present activities of our Federal Public Health
Service. These are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>1. The prevention of the introduction of infectious and contagious diseases.</p>

<p>2. The sanitary regulation of foreign commerce.</p>

<p>3. The observance of international sanitary treaties.</p>

<p>4. The prevention of the spread of infectious and contagious diseases from
one State to another through co-operation with State and municipal health authorities.</p>

<p>5. The collection and dissemination of sanitary information.</p>

<p>6. The conduct of scientific research in matters pertaining to the public
health.</p>

<p>7. The enforcement of sanitation in Federal territory and in connection
with Federal administrative affairs.</p>
</div>


<p class="center">THE PREVENTION OF THE INTRODUCTION OF INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS
DISEASES.</p>

<p>The chief national quarantine law is that approved February 15,
1893, amended and extended by acts of Congress approved August 12,
1894, March 2, 1901, and June 19, 1906.</p>

<p>Under these acts the maritime quarantine administration has become
national, many state stations having been voluntarily surrendered to the
Government, others supplanted by the General Government, because of
failure to comply with government regulations, and others superseded
by direct authority of law.</p>

<p>The diseases excluded from the country by the national quarantine
establishment are cholera, yellow fever, smallpox, typhus fever, leprosy
and plague.</p>

<p>Some quarantine stations are inspection stations only, but many
are large institutions, comprised of hospitals, quarters, barracks for
detention of crews and passengers, wharves and disinfecting machinery,
and boarding vessels, all requiring good administrative ability on the
part of the commanding officer, who must also be expert in the detection
of disease.</p>

<p>When a ship from a foreign port arrives off a port of the United
States, it is met by a quarantine officer for inspection under the national
regulations. Fifty medical officers of the service are engaged in this
work at forty-seven separate stations, extending along the Pacific, the
Gulf and Atlantic coasts from Alaska to Portland, Me. Without the
quarantine certificates given these officers and the bill of health obtained
at the foreign port, the ship would not be allowed entry by the
collector of customs and without his permit it would be unlawful for
the ship to unload its cargo.</p>

<p>At a few ports, not more than three or four in number, this inspection
is made by a State quarantine officer, a relic of the system which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
prevailed prior to 1893, when quarantine was considered a State rather
than a National function. They are obliged, however, to enforce the
National regulations, and are subject to inspection by the Federal officers,
and if they fail or refuse to comply with the United States regulations
the President is authorized to detail an officer of the Government
for that purpose.</p>

<p>In addition to the diseases remanded by quarantine, others are excluded
under laws relating to immigration, and for this purpose at the
principal ports of entry there are also stationed seventy medical officers,
who, during the past year, for example, examined more than 1,280,000
immigrants, certifying more than 30,000 of them on account of physical
and mental defects. The immigration laws exclude persons afflicted
with any loathsome or any dangerous contagious disease, or having mental
or physical defects which may affect their ability to earn a living.</p>

<p>Humanity requires the treatment in hospital of immigrants arriving
sick with ordinary as well as prohibitive diseases, and the large hospitals
connected with the stations are under the professional conduct of service
officers.</p>

<p>Although the immigration stations are under the control of commissioners
attached to the Department of Commerce and Labor, nevertheless
the medical officers are subject in their professional work to
supervision by the Public Health Service, and their instructions as to
the medical inspection of aliens are prepared by the Surgeon-General
and approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>


<p class="center">THE SANITATION OF FOREIGN COMMERCE.</p>

<p>At certain foreign ports and at certain times, depending upon the
presence of the various quarantinable diseases, either in the foreign
ports of departure or in the country contiguous thereto, officers of the
Public Health Service are detailed by the President to serve in the
offices of the American consuls, to assist them in enforcing the quarantine
regulations for foreign ports. These officers keep themselves informed
of the prevalence of contagious disease in these cities and the
surrounding country. They sign a bill of health which certifies that all
the regulations required to be enforced at foreign ports on vessels leaving
for the United States have been complied with.</p>

<p>This involves a knowledge of the point of origin of the freight and
passengers, disinfection of material from an infected locality, the personal
inspection of passengers, particularly steerage passengers, and
their detention if necessary. The power of enforcement of these regulations
lies in the above mentioned act of Congress approved February
15, 1893, which imposes a penalty of $5,000 upon any vessel from a foreign
port seeking to enter a port of the United States without this consular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
bill of health. The consul can legally refuse a bill of health if the
regulations are not complied with.</p>

<p>In this connection it may be said that officers of the Public Health
Service are stationed constantly at such ports as Hongkong, Shanghai
and Amboy, in China; Yokohama and Kobe in Japan; Salina Cruz,
Manzanillo and Puerto Mexico in Mexico; Guayaquil, Ecuador; La
Guaira, Venezuela, and Havana, Cuba. During the summer of 1911, on
account of cholera conditions prevailing in Italy, Russia and France,
there were officers of this service detailed in the offices of the American
consul at Naples, Genoa, Palermo, Messina and Catania, in Italy, at
Libau in Russia, and at Marseilles, France. In addition to this, officers
were ordered to several other foreign ports of departure, there to confer
with the American consular officers as to the enforcement of the regulations
for foreign ports, and for the purpose of insuring uniformity of
procedure.</p>

<p>The State Department has done much to assist in the quarantine and
sanitary work in foreign ports, through the interest it has aroused in
the said work on the part of its consular corps.</p>


<p class="center">THE OBSERVANCE OF INTERNATIONAL SANITARY TREATIES.</p>

<p>These treaties or conventions establishing them have been ratified by
the Senate of the United States, as well as by the other governments.</p>

<p>The International Sanitary Bureau of American Republics at Washington
was founded by the International Conference of American States
held in the City of Mexico in 1901. That conference also called for
international sanitary conventions, which are now held every two years.
Two have been held in Washington. The object of the conventions is
to freely discuss all matters relating to the public health and particularly
those which affect the American Republics, and the purpose of the
international Sanitary Bureau is to encourage the execution of the resolutions
or agreements decided upon by the conventions. The convention
held in Washington in 1905 drew up a treaty with regard to the quarantine
treatment of cholera, plague and yellow fever, which was signed
ad referendum by the official delegates, and has been confirmed by practically
all of the American Republics. At the meeting in Mexico in
December, 1907, action was taken which has brought the International
Sanitary Bureau at Washington into relations with the International
Office of Public Hygiene at Paris.</p>

<p>The International Office of Public Hygiene at Paris was formally
inaugurated December 9, 1907. It is the outgrowth of international
sanitary conferences at Rome, Venice and Paris, with regard to the
bubonic plague. The following governments are represented: Algeria,
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, British India, Bulgaria,
Egypt, Canada, France, Great Britain, Holland, Italy, Mexico, Peru,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
Persia, Portugal, Roumania, Russia, Servia, Sweden, Spain, Switzerland,
Tunis, Turkey and the United States.</p>

<p>Each of these governments has agreed to pay its pro rata of the
expenses necessary to maintain the international office. The principal
object of the office is to collect and bring to the knowledge of the participating
States facts and documents of a general character relating to
public health, especially as concerns infectious diseases—notably cholera,
plague and yellow fever—as well as the measures taken to combat
these diseases.</p>


<p class="center">PREVENTION OF THE SPREAD OF INFECTIOUS AND CONTAGIOUS DISEASES.</p>

<p>These operations are conducted under two laws. One is the national
quarantine act of 1893, already referred to, which contains practically
the same provisions for interstate as for maritime quarantine. The other
is the annual law passed by Congress appropriating an “epidemic
fund” which contains a provision that it may be used in aid of State
and local boards of health in the enforcement of their quarantine regulations,
as well as those of the national service—to be used, however,
only against certain specified epidemic diseases, viz., cholera, yellow
fever, smallpox, typhus fever and bubonic plague.</p>

<p>Now, with these two laws in hand, and when the appearance of any
of the above-named diseases in any State so require, the officers of the
Public Health Service are at once upon the scene with the double
object of seeing that the Treasury Interstate Quarantine Regulations
are enforced by the State or local authorities and to offer aid, as authorized
by law.</p>

<p>When aid is extended, the Government’s funds must be expended by
its own officers, and the latter are therefore placed in charge and have
the co-operation and assistance of the State or local authorities. They
have, therefore, the support of the State and local laws and regulations,
as well as those of the Federal Government. This is fortunate, since
experience has shown the importance, in a Republic like ours, of local
sympathy and support.</p>


<p class="center">THE COLLECTION AND DISSEMINATION OF SANITARY INFORMATION.</p>

<p>The Public Health Bureau, through its Division of Sanitary Reports
and Statistics, compiles and publishes each week a pamphlet called the
Public Health Reports. It contains a statistical report from all cities
in the United States of more than 10,000 inhabitants, and some others,
giving the morbidity and mortality in each city with regard to twelve
diseases and the total mortality from all diseases. It contains also a
statement of the weekly mortality in some 120 foreign cities from thirteen
communicable diseases. It gives special information concerning
quarantinable diseases and sanitary measures in the United States and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
foreign countries. The foreign information is received through the
United States consuls and service officers abroad.</p>

<p>Collective investigations are being made of the prevalence of pellagra,
infantile paralysis and leprosy.</p>

<p>A compilation has been prepared of state laws bearing upon reporting
diseases, with a view to increasing the collection of morbidity statistics
and bringing about improved methods and greater uniformity
in their collection.</p>


<p class="center">CONDUCT OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH.</p>

<p>In the District of Columbia, in a commodious building, the Public
Health Service has its hygienic laboratory, a research laboratory exclusively
for public health investigations. It is conducted in four divisions,
viz., bacteriology and pathology, chemistry, zoölogy and pharmacology.
This organization brings under the same roof, and in intimate association,
scientific workers in each of these several branches, interesting
facts developed in one line of investigation being made freely known
to the investigators in other lines of research.</p>

<p>Officers are detailed to receive instruction in this laboratory, thus
enhancing the scientific attainments of the corps and giving opportunity
for selection of those best qualified for permanent detail in
research work. In this manner specialists have been and are being
developed on various subjects, such as typhoid fever, pellagra, hookworm
disease, infantile paralysis, scientific disinfection, etc.</p>

<p>Public Health Service officers may be found in the States investigating
other diseases than those named in the epidemic law, viz., typhoid
fever, infantile paralysis, cerebro-spinal meningitis, hookworm disease,
malaria, pellagra, dengue fever, milk sickness, etc. These investigations
are usually made at the request of State health authorities. The bureau
at Washington, on receiving a request from a city or locality for expert
aid, invariably refers the request to the State Board of Health before
compliance.</p>

<p>The laws permitting these investigations are, first, the interstate
section of the quarantine law of 1893; and second, the act of
Congress approved March 3, 1901, providing a building for the hygienic
laboratory for investigations of contagious and infectious diseases and
matters relating to the public health. As the investigations require
laboratory examinations, they come within this last named law and the
appropriation which supports it.</p>

<p>In various States of the Union, there are thirteen establishments
engaged in the production of vaccines, antitoxins and serums, which
play so important a part in modern therapy. The variation in the
potency and the occasional impurity of these products caused Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
to pass an act July 1, 1902, requiring a license for their manufacture
for sale in interstate traffic.</p>


<p class="center">ENFORCEMENT OF SANITATION IN FEDERAL TERRITORY.</p>

<p>In the Philippine Islands, where the government is by commission
and a legislature, much work of value to the public health is performed
in the bureau of science under the insular government. There are,
however, in the several ports of the Philippines medical officers of the
Public Health Service under appointment from the Treasury Department
in Washington, engaged in the transactions of both incoming and
outgoing quarantine. Two of these officers, in addition to their supervision
of the national quarantine, are also director and assistant director,
respectively, of the public health of all the Philippines.</p>

<p>In Hawaii you will also find medical officers conducting the national
quarantine. They are also assisting the territorial health board in preventing
the recurrence of plague by the extermination of rats and
continuous bacteriological examination of those captured. One of these
officers is the official sanitary adviser of the Governor of Hawaii, and
is carrying on a campaign for the eradication of disease-bearing mosquitoes.</p>

<p>Here also may be observed the leprosy investigation station, also controlled
by our officers, both on the island of Molokai, where hospital and
other accommodations have been erected under the law of March 3,
1905, appropriating $100,000 for this purpose, and at the receiving station
at Honolulu, where cases are seen in the earlier stages.</p>

<p>In Porto Rico public health officers are enforcing the United States
quarantine regulations under the acts of Congress relating to Porto Rico
and national quarantine. The campaign which has practically eradicated
plague from San Juan is being conducted by the Federal Public
Health Bureau.</p>

<p>In the Canal Zone you will find two commissioned officers enforcing
quarantine regulations at Ancon on the Pacific and Colon on the Atlantic.
These officers are loaned to the Isthmian Canal Commission.
This is an important adjunct to the work of the canal, because it would
be useless to clean the zone if fresh importations of disease were permitted.</p>

<p>I will now devote a few words to the Health Bureau organization in
Washington by means of which all the functions or activities above
described are administered under one head.</p>


<p class="center">THE ORGANIZATION OF THE BUREAU OF PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE.</p>

<p>The law which changed the name of the Marine Hospital Service and
made it a Public Health Service was approved July 1, 1902. This law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
fixed the status of the officers, enlarged the hygienic laboratory and gave
it an advisory board, provided for the conferences with the State and
Territorial Boards of Health, provided for compilation and publication
of statistics, and directed that the President should prescribe rules for
the conduct of the service and the uniforms of its officers and employes.</p>

<p>It also provided for a Public Health and Marine Hospital Bureau at
Washington.</p>

<p>By an act of the Congress approved August 14, 1912, the name of
the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service was changed to Public
Health Service. The public health functions and duties of the service
were extended and certain changes were made in the salaries of the
officers.</p>

<p>The Public Health Service is under the supervision of the Secretary
of the Treasury, and is in charge of the Surgeon-General, who has six
Assistant Surgeons-General in charge of the Bureau Divisions. These
divisions are as follows:</p>

<p>1. Foreign and Insular Quarantine and Immigration.</p>

<p>2. Domestic (Interstate) Quarantine.</p>

<p>3. Personnel and Accounts.</p>

<p>4. Marine Hospitals and Relief.</p>

<p>5. Scientific Research and Sanitation.</p>

<p>6. Sanitary Reports and Statistics.</p>

<p>The above lengthy description of our present public health activities
has been necessary not only in order to demonstrate their character, and
scope, but also as an illustration of the variety of legal authority existing
for the enactment on the part of the general Government of public
health work.</p>

<p>This paper will not admit of the incorporation into it of the national
laws relating to public health which are now operative, but a careful
inspection of these laws will demonstrate that they will admit of such
interpretation as would make possible an almost unlimited amplification
of our present public health activities, the limit being only one of appropriations
and officers.</p>

<p>Careful analysis of the present health laws and activities will also
show that the Government is seeking to control nothing which any other
public health organization would wish to control. The foundation of the
national public health service is in the quarantine law of February 15,
1893, referred to above. The quarantine service is today almost entirely
national, notwithstanding a local sentiment for State or municipal control,
which exists in two or three cities only, and which it is believed is
destined to a short tenure for the following reasons:</p>

<p>It must be admitted that maritime quarantine should be a national
affair. It is a concomitant to commerce, over which under the Constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
the national government has absolute control, and it naturally belongs
to that department of the government regulating commerce in other
respects. In other words, it seems especially appropriate that quarantine
should be one of the functions of the Treasury Department which
registers, licenses and enrolls all merchant vessels of the United States,
inspects the hulls, boilers and machinery of such vessels, determines the
number of passengers which said vessels may carry and provides for the
housing and rations of the crews.</p>

<p>Besides this, it carefully examines all pilots upon American vessels
and determines upon granting them licenses. It enforces the navigation
laws and aids vessels in distress by an efficient revenue cutter service. It
also provides for the care of the sick of our merchant marine. Then
why should it relegate to a State authority, or health officer of some
small port, the one remaining act of surveillance over vessels, namely,
the determination as to whether they may be admitted to entry from a
sanitary standpoint? Why should it be left to a local appointee, responsible
only to a mayor or governor, the power to determine whether
all the people and the merchandise on vessels destined for all ports of
the United States, shall be permitted to enter without detention; and
why should it give this local officer power to detain such vessels; and
further than that, why should such local officers desire that power?</p>

<p>In the same way, the other activities of the Public Health Service
conflict in no way with the functions and prerogatives of the State and
local boards of health. Therefore, the term “national health control”
is a misnomer. The term “national health co-operation” would be much
more descriptive of the conditions actually existing. The interstate
health activities above described must of necessity be governmental functions.
The duties and responsibilities connected with them could not be
discharged by States with any degree of uniformity. Therefore, interstate
commerce laws are considered as appropriate national enactments,
and their operation encroaches upon no State or municipal rights.</p>

<p>It may be said with a feeling of conviction that the health control in
the United States today is just exactly in accordance with the desires of
the people. The people know that their State and municipal boards are
being aided by the health activities of the national government rather
than being encroached upon. In addition to this the Federal Public
Health Service and the State and municipal boards are acting in harmony
to the following ends: They are controlling commerce, in order
that commerce may not be clogged, and where necessary they are laying
the net of healthful restraint for purposes of good.</p>

<p>The government is receiving the good-will and co-operation of the
State and local health authorities in its work of catching and throwing
back the diseased persons who seek entrance to our shores in the great
Waves of immigration. They stand together to check the merchant or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
the manufacturer when he is ready or willing to risk the lives of the
people by furnishing improper or impure food or drug products. They
stand together to frustrate the lawyer who seeks by illegal technicality in
the behalf of an individual, or steamship company perhaps, to force a
way around a sanitary barrier erected for the protection of the people
at large. Again, the municipal, State and government health authorities
are standing together to stimulate the knowledge of our legislators
in public health needs and are combining their knowledge to insure reasonable
appropriations for the carrying out of general public health
projects.</p>

<p>The mission of the three classes of sanitarians above mentioned may
go still further. It may go to the extent of prodding the conscience of
the tardy doctor, and even to the sweeping aside of the sentimental obstructions
which the unenlightened are able to put in the path of the
conservation of life. There is ample law for present and probably for
future needs, and the control of national health remains, after all, today
where it has remained in the past, and where it always will remain, that
is, with the American people, not solely with the government, nor with
the State or municipal health agencies. Each of the great nations of the
world has gone about the direction of its public health work in its own
way, and always with the realization that the ideal is not necessarily the
practical, and what is best today may be supplanted by better tomorrow.</p>

<p>To summarize the situation, we have today State boards of health
in control of State sanitation, operating under proper and ample State
law. We have municipal health organizations operating under their own
legal authority, and finally we have the United States Public Health
Service, operating under several laws, as stated before, more far-reaching
in their scope than is indicated by the activities pursued under their
authority. The people, apparently, are satisfied so far as the Public
Health Service is concerned. When the people want anything more
they will demand it, and if available appropriations will not admit of
compliance with such requests they will be forthcoming. Therefore, I
am at a loss to suggest what additional health legislation is necessary or
desirable to be engrafted upon that already existing in this country, and
I am unable to see the necessity for any different plan of organization
so long as the people, in whose behalf the organization is being maintained,
are satisfied.</p>

<p>In closing, I wish to say that I have endeavored simply to place
various facts before this Congress, and while I do not pretend to have
exhausted this branch of the subject, I fear that I can not say the same
with regard to your patience.</p>


<p>President White here requested Dr. Henry Wallace, of Des Moines,
Iowa, to take the Chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Land Frauds”</span></h3>
<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>—We are now ready to hear the report of the
Committee on Lands and Agriculture. The first speaker will be Dr.
George E. Condra, of Lincoln, Neb., whose subject is “Land Frauds, or
Get-Rich-Quick Schemes.”</p>


<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Condra</span>—Mr. President and Delegates: Some of you may recall
the fact that the speaker has briefly outlined this subject at each of the
preceding Congresses, under the head, “Conservation of Business.”
The discussion offered at this time is based on reliable information secured
from many States. It is largely the result of field work. The
data are presented according to the viewpoint of Conservation and
should be so considered.</p>

<p>Do you fully realize that the principles of Conservation are permeating
every department of human industry, improving the processes, increasing
efficiency, and promoting common honesty, that the idea of
equity is increasing in force? That it is being extended to business not
for the purpose of holding it in check, but primarily for protection
against fraud? This movement for square dealing certainly is in order
for business is sore with graft and tracked by fraud at every turn.
Plain it is that many transactions in the realm of commerce fall outside
the sphere of true business. They grade from those that are doubtful
on through to those that are plainly fraudulent and therefore criminal.
The term “business,” however, has a splendid meaning which should be
conserved. It symbolizes honesty, stability, honor and reliability. Sharp
practice, double dealing and doubtful promotion are but parasites and
should be so regarded. They have no legitimate place in business and
are being eliminated.</p>

<p>Several persons have spoken in this Congress on pure food, eugenics,
etc. Their messages will tend to make people healthier and better fit to
be fathers and mothers. All this is good. Dr. Wiley and others have
emphasized the importance of pure food and health laws, but how many
go back of this matter of health and food to the land, or source of our
food and raiment and show the great need for pure land laws? (Applause.)
The State trains its sanitary engineers, lawyers and physicians
for their life work. It examines the lawyers and doctors before permitting
them to practice, but how about land agents? They are good and
bad. Many of them have no special qualifications for their work and
should not be permitted to do about as they please without restriction,
promoting this and that deal which may or may not have merit. Grant
me your closest attention and I will point out certain classes of fraud
that operate in connection with the development of mineral lands, irrigation,
fruit lands, eucalyptus culture, drainage, dry land farming and
the small tract propositions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p><em>Promotion of Mineral Land.</em>—The amount of money sent from the
country and town and city to doubtful mine promoters is enormous. The
return for this outlay is small, in some places less than one cent for each
dollar. Yet the public does not fully realize that nearly all reasonably
sure propositions are not available for wanton promotion, that a mere
prospect is not a mine, and that fraudulent promoters are hurting the
mining business.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><em>Oil and Gas Promotion.</em>—The excitement caused by a developing oil
field is intense. Agriculture gives way to a spirit of speculation and
overvaluation and everything looks good to an investing public. Fabulous
returns appear to be in sight for all who invest in time. This gives
opportunity for professional promoters to do their work, sometimes on a
large scale. They claim a sure thing even when wildcatting. So they
send unwarranted prospectuses broadcast and the money harvest is on.
It is difficult to place the criminality of such procedure. We only know
that it works out badly as a rule. You should know that it is bad business
to accept the unqualified statements of most oil and gas promotion
concerns as a basis for investment. These persons and concerns interfere
with legitimate development and should be brought under control.</p>

<p><em>Irrigation Schemes.</em>—The Federal Government spends vast sums in
developing the irrigation resources of several dry land States. Such
reclamation is of economic importance. Furthermore, many reliable individuals
and private companies do as well and even better in developing
some projects. As a result of successful irrigation thousands of
happy homes are made where once was only dry land. Notwithstanding
this fact there are fraudulent irrigation promoters. Scheming individuals
sell illegitimate propositions which can not succeed because of lack
of water, unsuitable land or heavy graft. Such promotion has gone on
to such an extent as to call for severe criticism by many practical irrigationists
of the West, and the Reclamation Department of the Federal
Government is increasing its diligence in checkmating the work of persons
who attempt to promote bad projects.</p>

<p><em>Fruit Land Promotion.</em>—Have you visited the great fruit districts of
Oregon, Washington and other Northwestern States? Do you know
what care is there given to the cultivation and marketing of apples especially?
The fruit is so perfect in form and color. It is accurately
graded for the Eastern and foreign markets. These splendid successes
are widely known and are taken advantage of by scheming persons who
promote the sale of any and all kinds of land in and near fruit districts.
One of the leading fruit men of Washington says that thousands and
thousands of dollars are going into the hands of concerns that are sure
to fail and that the fruit business is being hurt by such operations. The
trouble of it is that the average investor does not know that the fruit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
business is highly specialized, and that many matters concerning soil,
exposure, climate, markets, etc., not known to him, are the features that
determine success and failure. Furthermore, the fraudulent promoter
does not know, neither does he care.</p>

<p>Doubtful promotion of this kind is not confined to the Northwest
alone. It has hurt the South and may do damage to New York and
other States in which are lands well suited for fruit raising, if the proper
authorities do not conserve the larger interests of the industry and State
against promoters.</p>

<p><em>Eucalyptus Promotion.</em>—For many years the forests of the United
States have been in process of depletion. Some have seen in this, and
with good reason, an approaching timber famine. The alarm has been
sounded, and the demand has gone forth for better methods in timber
utilization, for fire protection, and tree planting. This is the right thing
without doubt, but it affords a loop-hole for promoters. It is understood,
also, that some trees grow faster and are more all-purpose than
others. The eucalyptus are of this kind. They are of many kinds.
Such trees can not be grown on any and every type of soil and are
limited somewhat by climate. It so happens that California, because of
its soil and climate, is the leading State in culture of eucalyptus. It has
several successful groves and larger plantings, yet the situation is promoted
for all it is worth, and perhaps more. The public (in the Central
and Western States) is worked by carefully-planned selling schemes.
The fact is that there is too much graft in some of them. The process
has gone on to such an extent as to cause the friends of eucalyptus planting
to sound a warning against such procedure. This should cause investors
to make a more careful inquiry of reliable persons, not controlled
by the promoters, before parting with money. The trees must have suitable
soil, climate, and care.</p>

<p><em>Drainage Schemes.</em>—One of the largest lines of development in the
United States is in the field of drainage, whereby swamp and flood lands
are improved. The amount of land that either has or can be reclaimed
by drainage is said to be about 75,000,000 acres. The Federal Government,
various States, companies, and individuals, are doing this work.
Much of such development is well founded, yet there are bad deals,
which might be called deliberate steals in some cases. Examples of these
exist in a few States and much money has been squandered on projects
that can never succeed. Teachers, ministers, farmers, merchants and
others are victimized. In the language of one of Florida’s representatives
at the National Irrigation Congress of this year, “Persons selling
certain wet lands of Florida are practicing fraud and should be prosecuted
as criminals. They are hurting the good name of Florida and
swindling people in the North.” This person severely criticized certain
cities of the North as being promotion centers. Further comment is not
necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p><em>Dry Land Deals.</em>—Much dry land promotion is fraudulent, caused in
part by misinformation on the part of agents, but due to some extent to
deliberate misrepresentation. For instance, there are places in Texas,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Colorado, western Nebraska, Wyoming, and other
States subject to such promotion. The fact is that a part of the land
in the dry area of each State named is well suited for dry farming, but
that unscrupulous agents sell anything and everything to unsuspecting
persons as being good, awaiting the plow and successful development.
So it is that geographic position has been overworked. The following
points are sometimes overdrawn in securing sales:</p>

<p>a. The idea that nearly all agricultural land is under cultivation.</p>

<p>b. The notion that dry farming methods are successful on almost any
kind of dry land.</p>

<p>c. That the climate, referring to the rainfall especially, is becoming
more favorable for agriculture in dry regions as the years go by. This
notion, used in deceiving thousands of people, is greatly in error.</p>

<p>d. Advantage is taken of such fluctuations in rainfall as occur from
year to year and at more or less regular periods, ten to twelve years
apart. During the wet years the country is boomed; at dry times the
people move out and industry wanes. These ups and downs are recurring
features on certain areas not permanently suited for farming.
The process works havoc with the misguided settlers, hurts a State that
encourages it, and brings no lasting beneficial results to land men who
manage the operation.</p>

<p>Apparently, Nature is no respecter of persons, especially so on the
dry, sandy lands. It is coming to be known that there is no permanent
change for the better in rainfall, frost belts or any thing of the kind.
Some lands are better suited for grazing than for ordinary farming and
should be so managed.</p>

<p>The speaker is pleased to be the servant of a State that stands strongly
against misrepresentation of land values. Such a policy works out the
greatest good in the long run. It breeds a healthy demand for a fact
basis of development and minimizes the tendency to “stand up” for the
home State by unwarranted “boostings.”</p>

<p><em>Land Schemes in General.</em>—There are many other land projects. The
public has invested largely in small tract propositions in Florida, Texas,
and other States. Much of this promoted land has considerable value,
but some of it is over-estimated, and many investors are quite apt therefore
to lose all or nearly all of their money. Certain kinds of land look
more inviting during one season of the year than at another. For example,
there are places in Texas and Mexico to which the promoters take
their victims in the dry season and to other lands during the wet season.
This year the speaker heard a Texas representative declare, in a national
meeting, that many of the small tract propositions, together with certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
other land schemes of his State, are filled with fraud. He criticized
northern people for promoting Texas. This should serve at least as a
warning to unthoughtful investors. The good agricultural propositions
of Texas and elsewhere are handled by responsible land agents.</p>

<p>The movement for the reclamation of the so-called abandoned lands
of some of the older States is quite apt to be hurt by unreliable promoters.</p>

<p><em>Misrepresentation and Overvaluation.</em>—Not only do some promoters
misrepresent propositions for the purpose of receiving gain therefrom,
but they often advance the sale price unduly. Many examples of this
kind have come to my attention. Two weeks ago I received a prospectus
from Oklahoma, advertising lead and zinc land for sale at $6.00 a block,
twenty feet square, making 1,089 blocks in the tract of ten acres. This
would be $6,534 for the land. I happen to know the region and own
land close to the small tract. The fact is that one can purchase such a
place at $10.00 or less an acre, or at not to exceed $100 for ten acres.
So the difference between $100 and $6,534 is too much of an advance for
those who invest. What do you think of such a deal? The persons handling
it use the general statement of a geologist which recites the fact that the
geological formation that contains zinc and lead in the Joplin District,
some thirty miles distant, extends through the promoted land. This
statement has no specific importance, but is sufficient for persons who
accept the “get-rich-quick” bait. It is my judgment that Oklahoma
should not permit such a clean-up. (Applause.)</p>

<p>The public craze for land makes it easy for promoters to do their
work. Many farmers, dominated by a spirit of consideration for their
children, accept the “spiel” and assurance of the “dopster,” sell in
agricultural regions and move onto nearly worthless land, believing that
it will become about like the old home place in time, and that each child
will then have a farm and home. May we not say that he who deceives
a family in this way is a mean man? (Applause.) Can you think of a
worse service to a community? Certain railroads are not free from
blame in that they promote this traffic. The farmer who accepts the bad
“dope” is also to blame. It has taken a long time for the people to
learn that mere belief, opinion, and sentiment are not strong enough
forces to overcome the influence of land not suited for agriculture.</p>

<p>If our land seekers could realize how important and far-reaching is
this matter of choosing favorable places for home building, they would
be less easily led astray. They would consider soil, climate, water supplies
and other necessary conditions of success, as they actually exist,
and be governed less by the old arguments and slogans so often used for
land development in general. They would pay less attention to deceptive
literature written for the special purpose of securing emigrants and
sales. They would inquire into the methods whereby this phase of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
land business is carried on, and avoid being carried off of their feet, especially
when on “home-seekers’” excursions and worked by a well-organized
plan.</p>

<p>Formerly, the newer States encouraged the work of grafting land
men. Time has shown, however, that this was bad business and really a
drawback to permanent development. The present trend is to conserve
the interests of those who go onto and manage the land, making it easier
for them to succeed. They are assisted by the publicity of useful facts
and the censure of fraud. Furthermore, it is coming to be recognized
that State emigrant agents, agricultural experiment stations, soil surveys
and Conservation Commissions should not lend their support to any
interest other than that which brings the best results to the people of
the State. They should stand for the policies that insure permanent
development and do so as their plain duty. Do you know how public
men are urged and tempted to further the interests of promotion concerns
and that there are plenty of opportunities to sell one’s influence?
That it requires diligence and courage to rightly serve the State? Happily,
our public-spirited citizens who have at heart the best and largest
interests of their States, stand strongly against misrepresentation
whether unintentional or not. They claim that doubtful promotion
serves only in closing deals, and in directing settlers to the land, but that
in the long run the process works a positive harm to the misguided
people and to the State as well, if the land is not suited for habitation.
Fortunately, most States are coming to this viewpoint. They have
learned that it pays to tell the truth when transplanting a population
and directing the permanent development of a State.</p>

<p>Where do you delegates stand on this proposition, and what is to be
the attitude of your States?</p>

<p><em>Promoters’ Methods.</em>—Do you know the signs of fraud? They are
exposed in the method used in securing money from the community. The
plan is about as follows: A selling scheme is perfected. It is constructed
in a way that leaves no flaws, apparently. Each agent learns
the scheme; he becomes skilled in applying it to the different types of
individuals. Too often it is of little concern whether the project has
merit or not. The chief object is to get money. Extravagant claims
are made in which returns of 100 per cent. or more a year are said to be
a sure thing. The influence of nationality, church, and fraternal orders
are brought to bear in securing sales. The support of persons with good
standing in the community is secured. Those who assist the promoter
are given a reduction for their influence. The dope is given them often
and systematically. So they soon realize the greatness of the project.
This is promotion psychology. The land is offered at high enough price
to permit reduction for quick sale, which bait works in many cases.
Persons filled with greed for money are easy victims. The above kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
of thing, though less common than formerly, is practiced in most States,
and the wonder of it is that it can continue and why it is permitted to
continue. It is fraudulent and should be stopped entirely if we are to
conserve the interests of good people.</p>

<p><em>Effects of Land Fraud on Local Business.</em>—Many families lose
enough through fraudulent entanglements to give a college education to
the son, a piano to the girls, and general improvements for the home or
farmstead. The drain is away from home and school. Perhaps the
greatest loss is the people who are lured to places where in many cases
they are less well off than in the old home. Persons who lose in bad
deals become suspicious of real business done by reliable men in the community.
They refuse to invest in local developments in which the returns
are sure, though smaller than those promised by promoters. Many
are put out of business entirely by land frauds.</p>

<p>Do you agree with me in that it is not good business to farm the land,
cash in its fertility and then scatter the proceeds among grafters? Let
us quit chasing the ends of the rainbow, and turn our attention more
towards the right use of the fruits of our labor in education and home
building. (Applause.)</p>

<p><em>Regulation.</em>—There are many laws for the conservation of business.
The Federal Government prosecutes persons who make fraudulent use
of the mails. There is opportunity under the law to recover on account
of misrepresentation; but these laws are not sufficient. Public sentiment
is now ripe for the enactment of special laws to conserve business
against land frauds. Nebraska has made a special study of the subject,
reduced fraudulent procedure by the force of publicity and public
opinion, and will pass special conservation laws in its next Legislature.
Kansas has gained distinction by the enactment of the well-known
“Blue Sky Law.” This is good so far as it goes. It provides for registration,
reports, supervision and penalties. Many States, as, for example,
Wisconsin, Wyoming, and Texas, are to undertake legislation of
this kind at the next sessions of their Legislatures.</p>

<p>Provision should be made in the special act against land frauds for
field examination and report upon properties offered for sale. This field
work might be done by the State Soil Survey, or the State Conservation
Commission.</p>

<p>An essential feature of the act will be the registration of realty agents
and the furnishing of proof that they are competent and reliable. This
will reduce the number of land agents and insure the responsibility of
those permitted to do business. The Western realty men are now
framing a law of this kind to meet the needs of the various States.</p>

<p>Apparently there is no opposition to the proposed legislation for it is
to conserve business and eliminate fraud. It is sure to receive the support
of all unless we except those who make gain through doubtful promotion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
If opposition appears before the various Legislatures it will
have the embarrassing position of being on the side of fraud.</p>

<p><em>Summary.</em>—Let me close this report with the following statements:</p>

<p>1. This discussion, though favorable to reliable land agents is
against doubtful promoters.</p>

<p>2. Realty agents should have a practical knowledge of land classification,
soil types and the land business.</p>

<p>3. Reliable and competent real estate agents have an important
place in the State. They are against promoters and promotion values.</p>

<p>4. No one should deal with an agent who is not favorably known and
is not good at the bank.</p>

<p>5. See the land you purchase. Also get a reliable report upon it
from a competent, disinterested party. Base your transaction on facts—not
on opinions. Get a good title and not a mere promise to deliver.</p>

<p>6. Keep out of the “get-rich-quick” schemes. Quit chasing the
ends of the rainbow. If your fever gets too high, consult a banker.</p>

<p>7. As a rule, it is best to avoid the “home seekers’” excursions and
“boom” literature, unless you are sure of your footing.</p>

<p>8. Consult disinterested old-time residents whose places show that
they are actual, successful tillers of the soil in the locality where you are
to buy. They will give you the farm value, and not the promotion
value.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, are you ready to support in this important
movement? (Applause.)</p>


<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>—I am sorry we haven’t half an hour longer to
give Dr. Condra to skin those skunks.</p>

<p>We will hear from Mr. Charles S. Barrett, President of the Farmers’
Union, and finally from Mrs. Lund, of California. I want these speakers
to show their appreciation, their gallantry, by giving her the last five
minutes, and I am going to call them down unless they do.</p>


<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Condra</span>—It has been suggested that we close this discussion in
one minute. I am very sorry that neither Mr. Barrett, or Dr. Bateman
can be heard.</p>

<p>My friends, when a State puts upon its statute book an adequate
law, no fake concerns will seek to do business in that State. That is
true. Now, we ask that your committee be continued to the end that
we may report the conditions of the soil and the development of the soil.
I thank you and give ten minutes additional time to the lady.</p>


<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>—It is my great pleasure to introduce Mrs. Haviland
H. Lund, of California, whose subject is the “Conservation of Land
and the Man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Conservation of Land and the Man”</span></h3>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Lund</span>—It is a great pleasure to follow Dr. Condra, because his
speech is such a good precedent for what I have to say.</p>

<p>If the masses of the American people knew what one man could accomplish
for himself, physically and financially, upon from one to five
acres of land, this knowledge would revolutionize the life of the
Nation. The congestion in our cities is more than a country-wide
menace. It is an unnecessary outrage. There is land, good, health-giving
land, enough for all the people.</p>

<p>The conservation of the man has been too long overlooked. The
commercial policy of the Nation could scarcely be called far-sighted—so
wasteful have we been of all natural resources.</p>

<p>We have despoiled our forests, impoverished our soil, given away
the public domain. Our labor conditions in many respects shame us in
comparison with other nations. Looking about today, it would seem
that our thought has been “Get all we can, no matter how, and waste
it as we will, for after us, the deluge!” But a new commercial and
political spirit is being born; a renaissance of righteousness is setting in,
and the commercial leaders of the country are taking stock, as it were,
of the actual situation.</p>

<p>Big business men are realizing that a healthy man is worth more in
dollars and cents than a half sick one; it is recognizing that sanitation
is a good investment. It is beginning to wake up to the fact that the
children are more valuable producing machines when they are well protected,
housed, fed and educated. The cry of the philanthropist to give
because it was right and necessary that these conditions be ameliorated,
has met with only sporadic response, but this new call to do the right
thing because it pays in dollars to do it, is meeting a greater answer
from the people.</p>

<p>Little Farms Magazine found it impossible to evade the responsibility
imposed upon it by its readers. We roused them to a desire to go
out upon the land—to try the new condition. They came to us for information.
We could not go into the land business. We decided to
form “Forward-to-the-Land Leagues” in all principal cities.</p>

<p>Moneyed men are not asked to contribute alms but only to invest
their money at a nominal rate of interest, which the workingman with
his own home and garden, with health and a living assured, is willing
and able to pay. This has been proved where the experiment has been
tried in the manufacturing cities in England, and in such communities
as San Ysidro, Southern California, in our own country.</p>

<p>The work of the Little Farms Magazine in the founding of these
Forward-to-the-Land Leagues has been unique and necessary. And its
purposes two fold.</p>

<p>In the first place, it was of the utmost importance in meeting the
grave problems confronting the nation, particularly that of the bringing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
our ratio of agricultural production where it safely balances the ratio of
population, to have a medium by which knowledge of the intensive methods
of agriculture could be brought to the individual.</p>

<p>The widespread interest in the forward-to-the-land movement, which
has been taken up alike by press and magazine, has created a hunger for
specific information which occasional columns of general news can not
satisfy. Little Farms Magazine tells, specifically, how a small acreage
will yield and has yielded, industrial independence. It quotes stories of
those who have made good after leaving the old work of bookkeeping and
clerking and taken a “little farm.”</p>

<p>The problem which the farm presents today is not the same as that
of yesterday. The loneliness and isolation no longer obtains. The message
that the Little Farms Magazine takes to the world today is that
<em>scientific agriculture makes the acreage necessary for individual maintenance
so small that social life can be developed on the farm in the most
ideal manner</em>. The magazine advocates the upbuilding of the social
center, with its library, its clubhouse and gymnasium, its moving pictures
and mechanical music.</p>

<p>As I came through the country from the Pacific Coast and saw the
empty acres of farm land waiting, and then entered the big eastern
cities, and looked into the hopeless, pallid faces of its people, I could
think that the earth, if it had a voice, would cry aloud with the cry of
Him of long ago, who said: “How often would I have gathered thee as a
hen gathereth her chickens, but ye would not.”</p>


<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>—There are fifteen minutes left. If Mr. Barrett,
President of the Farmers’ Union, is here we would be glad to give it to
him.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Farmers’ Union”</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Barrett</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Speaking for
approximately three million American farmers, I can say with absolute
accuracy that the primary article in the creed of Conservation should be
the conservation of the man on the land.</p>

<p>In volume and variety of resources, the United States is the mightiest
nation in the world. It is true that the British Empire may,
through its dependencies, have a greater territorial reach, but from the
standpoint of a continuous stretch of land and the body of acres cultivated
and susceptible to cultivation, America admittedly leads the world.</p>

<p>The effect of this handicap is indicated not only in the present
breadth of our domestic and international commerce, but to a greater
extent in the promise of its more wonderful commercial conquests yet to
come. The Nation is barely on the threshold of its destiny. That fact
should not mislead us as to the difficulties in the way of making the destiny
real, and not merely a boastful prophecy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>In the process of transmuting our possibilities into assets—what is
the dominant factor? The American farmer. I challenge any of my
distinguished audience to mention a single phase of commerce, one feature
of trade, the smallest detail of actual subsistence that does not
eventually trace back to the man plodding out there on the acres.</p>

<p>Napoleon said an army traveled on its belly. He could have said,
with equal truth, that civilization travels on its belly. And the farmer
is the factor that fills the Great American Stomach, and that keeps full
every dinner pail, regarding which we have heard so much during political
campaigns. More than that, he also clothes the armies of development.
Nor must we forget that with the South’s cotton as the lever, he
keeps the international trade balance on the American side of the ledger.
You tell me the manufacturer plays a large part in our current and our
probable development. This is true. You tell me also, that what might
be called trade-strategy, pure and simple—the proverbial “Yankee
shrewdness”—is going to win for America the bulk of the world’s business.</p>

<p>I do not dispute these assertions. But I answer: That back of
trade-strategy and of dollar-diplomacy is—the American farmer. Without
him, all would be in vain; without him, all of those resources we
agree ought to be conserved would melt into impalpable air.</p>

<p>Let us admit, then, that the farmer is the keystone in the arch not
only of national advance, but of sheer national existence. His problems,
then, are the Nation’s problems and his welfare, the Nation’s welfare.
No nation is stronger than its farmers. If the farmer is poorly nourished,
if the Government is negligent of his rights, indifferent to his
mental development and moral soundness, the way will be surely blocked
to our national march forward.</p>

<p>It is to the vital interest of America to cultivate intensively not only
the farm, but—what is more important—to cultivate intensively the
farmer. What use to conserve our resources, unless we conserve the
man behind the resources? The stability of national progress and of
government itself is dependent upon conserving the farmer.</p>

<p>All of you within hearing of my voice may say: “We concede these
facts. Are we not, right now, trying to aid the farmer, to conserve him,
to intensively cultivate his possibilities and safeguard his rights?” And
I answer: “Probably you are. But you can not help—you can not
conserve—you can not cultivate the farmer unless you mix and mingle
with him in the first person—not for twenty-four hours, but more likely
for twenty-four months or twenty-four years.” I give full credit to
the splendid intentions of the men who have tried and who now are
trying to aid the farmer. But you can not adequately grasp his problem
by using field-glasses from the convention hall or interviewing him
over a long distance telephone, so to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>The scientists who are searching for secrets, the missionaries who are
looking for converts, use neither of these methods. They go straight to
the scene of battle. And so must all persons do, my friends, if they
expect intelligently to conserve, to cultivate the American element which
is the pivot of all other elements in this country. Study him at first
hand, then your sympathies will be practical, not theoretic; your suggestions
based on conditions, not on conjecture. Fight with him, side
by side, in the ranks, day by day. That is the only way you can learn
of the foes—not the least of which is his own weakness—which he has
to combat, and what his victory means to the weal or woe of this common
country of ours.</p>


<p>At this point President White reassumed the Chair.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The ex-President of this Congress, familiarly
called “Uncle Henry,” and, in dignified circles, Dr. Henry Wallace, but
who doesn’t like the name and prefers “Uncle Henry,” will speak tonight,
as will Judge Ben B. Lindsey, of Denver, Colo., the children’s
friend.</p>

<p>The morning session is now at an end. We hope you will get back
here at 2 o’clock, because we have a very full program.</p>

<p>The Congress reconvened in the Murat Theater, at 2:00 o’clock p. m.,
and was called to order by President White.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—On account of Professor Fairchild’s being called
away, having to leave on an early train, we will listen to his address
first this afternoon. Professor Fairchild is foremost in the ranks of
modern education, in teaching the conservation of human life, the conservation
of the soil, and everything that goes to make up thorough manhood
among the boys of the land. I now introduce to you Prof. E. T.
Fairchild, of Topeka, Kan., President of the National Educational Association,
whose subject is “The Duty of the Teacher.”</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “A Plea for More Education Opportunities.”</span></h3>
<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Fairchild</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of the
Congress: With your permission I want to change my subject as printed.
It is not the subject of my remarks this afternoon. I should like
to call it “A Plea for More Equal Educational Opportunities.”</p>

<p>In the few minutes allowed me, I can only hope to sketch briefly some
of the conditions that confront us today. I shall have some things to say
that represent definitely a great lack of progress, but that I may not be
labeled as a pessimist, I wish at the beginning to state as my conviction
that the present is the best moment educationally that the world has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
ever seen. Had I the time, I should like to describe to you the marvelous
progress that has taken place in certain types of our educational
activity.</p>

<p>The growth of our universities and colleges is little short of marvelous.
In a single decade in these United States the increase in enrollment
has been fully 98 per cent. This increase in enrollment has also been
manifested in Europe, in England, where there has been a genuine
increase in the number of provincial universities. The increase in enrollment
in the past ten years is most marked in Germany. In Germany,
where there have been no new institutions erected the increased enrollment
in a single decade represents 60 per cent. Such is the history of the
increased enrollment, which, with increased efficiency in the way of larger
and more efficient faculties, has taken place in this country and in
Europe. It is a world-wide movement, my friends, and so far as I can see,
is a recognition that the best field of opportunity to the ambitious and
capable youth is through the college.</p>

<p>Then we come to the story of the success of our high schools. Here
again the growth has been phenomenal. Those schools in number and in
enrollment have gone forward by leaps and by bounds. In a single State,
in my own, if I may be pardoned for this allusion, let me tell you what
has happened in five years. The increase in the number of high schools
in five years is one hundred per cent. and the increase in the number of
teachers one hundred and twenty per cent. This is simply typical of the
condition all over these United States. Again we have a concrete instance
of the conviction upon the part of our people that the boy or girl
of today who is to have something like an equal chance tomorrow, should
have the opportunities provided by our high schools. I wish I had time
to expand before you this growth and its meaning to our nation, but it is
not my purpose to discuss that at length. I want to say, however, that
as the result of this marvelous activity and growth we have had in our
high schools and our graded schools in the cities, we have reached a
maximum term. We are having a constantly enriched curriculum and
generous expenditures are being made everywhere. Modern buildings,
the latest word in lighting and heating and ventilation are found everywhere.
Thorough organization characterizes this type of our educational
work.</p>

<p>A vital point in the development of this growth, this high organization,
is the expert supervision that has charge of these schools everywhere.</p>

<p>It is upon these higher institutions, the universities, the colleges and
the high schools that the emphasis of educational thought and interest
has been bestowed. Here notable investigations are constantly in progress
with a view to still greater efficiency. Here the active and moral
influence of the best and wisest of our country finds expression. Every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
one is aware of these educational activities and all are proud of them.
We are spending money most generously for the city grade schools, for
the high schools, for the colleges and the universities.</p>

<p>But, good friends, now I come to the essential thing I wish to present
to your attention. Of the twenty-five million boys and girls in the
United States today of school age a majority receive their foundation
training in the rural schools, or in an environment that is characteristically
rural. And what of these types of schools? Do we find the same
advancement? Do we find the same public concern? Do we find the
same skill and organization and supervision? Do we get such results as
are being secured by city schools? They do not measure up in the character
of teaching, friends, in the kind of courses of study, in the length
of the term, in the results obtained and this is perfectly obvious to the
student of rural schools. There has been no such progress. What we
have too often is the untrained teacher in the rural schools; terms ranging
from three months up to six and seven; buildings that lack in every
modern application of light, heat, ventilation and sanitation and all
attractiveness; ground that too often is the sore spot of the community;
houses that too often represent or suggest the pest house rather than a
place of learning; inadequate support financially and inefficient supervision.</p>

<p>I want to speak briefly, then, to you in the few minutes that I have
left as to four vital defects, as I view them, that it seems to me are the
defects that we, as a nation, ought to undertake to remedy.</p>

<p>First, we have too many untrained, inexperienced teachers in these
schools. In saying this, my good friends, I am not unmindful of the fact
that in thousands of communities in this country of ours are to be found
rural conditions that are most pleasant, that there are thousands of
teachers in rural schools consecrated to their work, performing a daily
service for those boys of inestimable value; but listen, in one of the
largest cities of this Union the superintendent of public instruction in a
report said of 10,500 rural school teachers 9,400 are themselves but
eighth grade graduates. I want to avoid being too explicit in pointing to
the places, but I personally know of a State, a State that stands well
above the average, I think, educationally in the United States, in which
of the 8,000 rural school teachers 4,400 in 1910 had only such training as
is found in the country school and not beyond the eighth grade. In too
many places this condition prevails. I believe I am well within the truth
when I say that of the teachers of the fourteen million boys and girls in
the rural districts of America today who are being taught, more than
fifty per cent. of those teachers have themselves an academic training
that does not extend beyond the grades.</p>

<p>But, to return to the subject of the high schools, that I spoke of a
moment ago. See how conditions have changed as to the training and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
kind and character of the teachers that must be placed therein. It is
rare that you see a teacher of a high school who is not a graduate of a
high school and in many cases of a normal school. In the rural school,
the first defect is that we have too many poorly trained teachers.</p>

<p>The next thing I wish to speak of as a great defect in our present
system is our manner of raising and distributing tax. You are aware
that the prevailing unit of school organization in America is the district.
In my own State we have 13,400 teachers; to boss, guide and direct those
13,400 teachers is an army of 30,000 school officers. By the way, he is the
most numerous officer in this country. Within a radius of three miles you
will run across a school officer in most of the States of the Union, a condition
that makes for lack of uniformity, lack of singleness of purpose,
the most wasteful, the most extravagant system that could be devised.
But I want to speak a word in regard to taxation. The trouble is, good
friends, that our system of distribution of taxes is utterly unfair and
utterly prejudicial to the best interests of the child. On the one side of
the road is a district having a splendid valuation with a low tax that
may maintain eight months of school with a splendid teacher, a good
building, and on the other side of the road, the maximum reached by law
or gone beyond it, they are only able to supply the most inferior facilities
for the boys and girls. The day must come when we shall have a
prevailing system at least with the county as a unit for the taxes to be
raised and distributed, so that the boy or girl who lives in some poor part
of that county or State shall have the same opportunity as far as money
will bring it to have a good teacher. The fact is that poor communities
are the ones that ought to have the best teachers in all this land (applause),
and that the contrary is too often true I am sure you will all
agree.</p>

<p>Let me say as to the courses of study now a word or two. I have,
good friends, said to you that there are twenty-five million boys and girls
of school age in America, fourteen million of these in rural schools. Now,
listen, of these fourteen million less than twenty-five per cent. are so
much as completing the work of the grades in this, the morning of the
twentieth century. If this does not spell tragedy then I have no means
of interpreting these facts. Less than twenty-five per cent. To assign
the reasons for this is difficult, but because of the kind and character of
these schools, because they are lacking, because they are not making the
progress, because they have not the attractiveness that our city systems
have, is a reason why these boys and girls do not stay. But there is
another and further reason. The course of study too often lacks vitality;
somehow and someway we have not grasped the thought that the school
has a larger and wider duty than consuming all its time and energy in
text book knowledge. Somehow and someway we have failed to see there,
as we are coming to see in our more highly organized system, that to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
interest that boy and girl, to send them out capable, self-sustaining citizens,
we must do more than consume our time and energies on the text
book knowledge. I should like to see a reasonably but not rigidly classified
course of study with adequate attention to fundamentals, to large
opportunity for hand work and with every possible connection between
the experience of the school and the actualities of life. We must vitalize
these schools. Another important thing in connection with our rural
schools is this: the great majority of these boys and girls are denied high
school privileges. Here in the city of Indianapolis with the splendid
system of high schools that they have small wonder is it that the boy and
girl in the grades if possible persevere in the work, looking forward
always to the opportunity to get this liberal education afforded in the high
school. Often this is not true in the country. As I said a moment ago,
the great majority of these boys and girls are denied such opportunities,
denied for geographical reasons, for financial reasons. If every township
there could be created a rural high school, in its course of study
emphasizing the things that are most needed in the lives of the boys and
girls in that township, preparing them by a well developed and organized
course of study for the great and important and practical business
of life—if such an institution could be put within the reach of those fourteen
million boys and girls, don’t you agree with me that many more
than twenty-five per cent. would finish the work of the grades in the
hope that they, too, might enter these schools and enjoy their advantages.
And so I say, there is another great defect that some way ought to be
overcome.</p>

<p>Now, just a word or two further. The last defect that I will mention
is the question of supervision. In my judgment the commanding reason
for the development and growth of our city schools is the skilled supervision
supplied by the city superintendent. If we could have like supervision
in these schools in the country the development would be marvelous
and it would be rapid and vital. We have county superintendents.
They have them here in Indiana. We have them in our State, but in no
single instance so far as I am aware, is this supervision adequate. First
of all, to remedy the question of the supervision of our schools, the question
of the superintendency should be taken absolutely out of politics.
(Applause.) It is a crime against the children of this nation to select
either a city superintendent or a county superintendent upon any other
basis than educational qualifications. (Applause.) The children of Indiana,
the children of every other State of this Union will never come into
their own, good friends, until the supervising element is selected because
of their being experts in the job they are looking for.</p>

<p>Now, just one other thing on that. It is perfectly preposterous to
expect a superintendent in a county such as there are in my State, for
illustration, to visit one hundred and fifty or more schools, going over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
roads in all times of year, in all conditions, to make his visits worth
while. He may get there once a year. We ought to imitate Oregon in
this respect. In Oregon they have subordinate superintendents, one for
every twenty schools. There they can accomplish something.</p>

<p>My time is more than taken. You have been patient, as has your
President. I thank you most sincerely. I only regret that I can only
touch the edges of this problem.</p>

<p>In conclusion, you representatives of this National Conservation Congress,
here is the problem. The great thing we need to do, first of all, is
to make public everywhere the actual condition of the rural schools.
Publicity is the first step; organization is the second; organization of
national scope and of State scope. Give me twenty common people in
any State in this Union and I will guarantee to see that the rural schools
make more real genuine advance in the next five years than under ordinary
circumstances they would do in ten years.</p>

<p>The country is the Nation’s great recruiting ground. Here we look
for the best men and women of tomorrow who are to take leadership, who
are to represent in their actions and in their lives the good red blood
that characterizes the Anglo-Saxon race. Are we doing our duty when
but a paltry three million five hundred thousand out of a total of fourteen
million are not so much as accomplishing the work of the grades?
(Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—Louisiana has been first and foremost in several
phases of Conservation. Louisiana stands first in making forestry possible
by wise and beneficial laws that encourage forestry, and I think
Louisiana stands among the first in its State Board of Health, doing
something worth while in every parish. I have the pleasure of introducing
to you Dr. Oscar Dowling, of New Orleans, Louisiana, President
of the Louisiana State Board of Health, who will speak on “Hygiene in
Relation to Public Health.”</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Hygiene in Relation to Public Health”</span></h3>
<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dowling</span>—Mr. Chairman, Members of the National Conservation
Congress, Ladies and Gentlemen: We are very glad to have this opportunity
to appear before this great Congress. In the beginning I want to
say that we owe much of our enthusiasm to the good work of the Indiana
State Board under Dr. Hurty, and to your pure food department, under
Dr. Barnard; also to Dr. Evans, of Chicago, and Dr. Wiley, of Washington.
We have endeavored to imitate them in some ways, but nevertheless,
in some ways we have fallen short.</p>

<p>Hygiene, the science of preservation and promotion of health, in some
form, has been recognized by every nation since the dawn of civilization.</p>

<p>Among the people of antiquity, conquest and domination were directly
dependent on physical vigor, hence their laws regulating this feature
of national life. Among the Greeks, the health idea was embodied in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
cult of Hygeia which arose hundreds of years before the Christian era,
consequent probably to a devastating plague. In the early period of
Rome, when courage and patriotism were cardinal virtues, physical development
was provided for and emphasized. Social and political fluidity
in the middle ages precluded the evolution of organized thought or systems
in sanitary science.</p>

<p>Individuals set aside conventional thought and method and strove
with Nature that they might learn her secrets; their work was not in
vain, but with few exceptions their discoveries were unimportant.</p>

<p>The experimental method popularized in Baconian philosophy gave
an impetus to the study of the physical sciences, but many decades passed
before notable deeds were recorded. It was the nineteenth century, scientific
in spirit and achievement, that made vital the long result of time
and opened a perspective before undreamed of. The awakened health
conscience of today is the crystallized result.</p>

<p>In scientific annals, the discoveries of the bacteriologist rank among
the first. Perhaps, in the evolution of knowledge no truths are more
potential. Within a generation the influence is marked, not only in relation
to the individual and community, but in effect on the civilized
world. The sanitarian with this knowledge was enabled to demonstrate
control of environment. The success of the experiment has opened a new
world just as surely as did the discovery of October, 1492.</p>

<p>The changed viewpoint of the relative value of hygiene in its application
to life is due not wholly to the discoveries in medical science. It
is one phase of the general awakening to the defects of the present social
order: a manifestation of the modern attitude toward “waste.” Efficiency
implies economy, not alone of expenditure, but of material resource
and vital force.</p>

<p>Conservation and preservation of the material wealth of the country
is dominant in the intellectual activity of all enlightened people. But it
becomes increasingly apparent that the Nation which conserves its mines,
forests, soil and sources of power is poor indeed if its men lack virility
and mental initiative. This thought is back of the public health movement.
The impulse is in part commercial, in part scientific. It grows
out of recognition of the futility of remedial and philanthropic measures
and the conviction of the potentialities of science for human betterment.
In import the movement is ethical and spiritual; it is beyond question
the greatest of modern times.</p>

<p>This meeting is significant of the changed attitude toward the Nation’s
greatest natural resource—its people. The Congress is national,
its purpose conservation, its main topic—to quote from the invitation—the
conservation of vital resources. There is significance also in the
topics selected for discussion in the health section. They relate to the
larger aims of sanitary science. In the popular mind health work has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
reference only to superficial conditions, control of epidemics, cleaning of
streets and similar activities, but the hygienist knows that sanitary regeneration
means an attack on many existing institutions, customs, practices
and methods that lie deep in the roots of the social structure.</p>

<p>Housing, child labor, industrial occupations, labor insurance, vital
statistics, food supply, community methods and conditions are the subjects
chosen for discussion. Their primary importance is apparent.</p>

<p>The period of twenty minutes allotted for the opening of this division
makes imperative only brief suggestive statements of the essentials
in their relation to public health and individual well-being.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawrence Veiller, in the Annals of the American Academy, says:
“We have paid dear for our slums.... No one has ever attempted
to estimate the cost to the Nation of our bad housing conditions, because
it is an impossible task.... Who can say of the vast army of the unemployed
how large a portion of the industrially inefficient are so because
of lowered physical vitality caused by disadvantageous living conditions?
Of the burden which the State is called on to bear in the support
of almshouses for the dependent, hospitals for the sick, asylums for
the insane, prisons and reformatories for the criminal, what portion can
fairly be attributed to adverse early environment?” Describing surroundings,
the author continues: “The sordidness of it all, the degrading
baseness of it, unfortunately is withheld from the eyes of most of us.
What it can mean to the people who have to live in the midst of it we
can but faintly conceive. Let us frankly admit that these conditions result
in imposing upon the great mass of our working people habits of
life that are more compatible with the life of animals than with that of
human beings.”</p>

<p>Moreover, not alone in the slums do these conditions exist. In almost
every city of the Union, a few blocks from the main thoroughfares, there
are congested districts unspeakably bad.</p>

<p>With the knowledge we now have of the relation to health and sickness
of air, sunlight and propagating agencies of disease incident to dirt,
it is nothing short of criminal to tolerate such conditions. If physical
suffering only were the result, indifference would be unpardonable, but
overcrowded homes, insanitary in every respect, make for low standards
of decency and morality. Vice, with its correlatives, disease and pauperism
result. Often crime and insanity make the chain complete. The conditions
of life in the middle ages as recorded in history seem to us barbarous
in the extreme; relatively, ours really are. Then, there was no
certainty as to the effect of insanitary environment; the people did not
know; we do, yet with inexplicable indifference communities not only let
the worst obtain, but they permit a perpetuation of the system. Authorities
stand aghast at the expense involved in the tearing away of a whole
section of a city, but the cost of such a measure easily, often probably,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
may become a mere item in comparison with the economic loss from an
epidemic of a virulent type.</p>

<p>It is a hopeful sign that a few enlightened municipalities have set an
example in remodeling districts, not only in the erection of comfortable
homes, but further in the establishment of healthful and beautiful environments.
The housing problem is one of the most difficult and complex
of our day. It can be solved only by enlightened legislation supported
by public opinion.</p>

<p>About a century and a quarter ago the factory system began to
develop with intensity in England. Later, in this country, it grew by
leaps and bounds. Child labor with its attendant evils was a logical result.
For nine years there has been systematic effort to control the unhygienic
features of the system. Some good has been accomplished, but
because of the nature of the problem progress is slow. The injury to the
child is plainly apparent. Long hours in poorly ventilated rooms, with
constant use of the same set of muscles, stunts and dwarfs the body;
equally, the mind. Toil of this nature uses up the young life; it leaves
the State the burden of caring for an individual hopelessly inefficient if
not worse. But of more importance is the consequential physical deterioration.
If these youthful toilers grow to maturity their bodies are devitalized;
if they marry their children are almost invariably low in vitality.
Hygiene in its application does not imply the remedy of existing conditions
alone for the individual or the present; it looks to the future.
Therefore, protection of the child is a principle of paramount importance.</p>

<p>Child labor laws are now more humane than a few years ago; conditions
in many factories have been vastly improved. But as yet we are far
from an ideal stage in the regulation and supervision of this feature of
industrial life.</p>

<p>Every argument concerning the employment of children in factories
may be applied to women engaged in similar occupations. In the mills
and shops where women stand all day, where they endure for hours not
only unhygienic environment, but in addition mental anxiety, where the
whip “employed by the week only” is held over them, the nervous strain
as well as physical exertion saps the very foundations of vitality. Investigations
made by Dr. R. Morton of New York, show the health of industrial
women is proving a serious thing in the United States, and unless
conditions are bettered that there will be a general breakdown of the
working women of the country. Nor is this the sum total of the consequences.
In the children of these women low vitality is perpetuated.
Records quoted by Dr. George Reid, Health Officer of Stafford, England,
give the mortality of children under one year of age as greater among
those of mothers who work in factories than among home mothers. Statistics
compiled by him show the death rate one hundred and forty-five per
one thousand births for infants of home mothers and two hundred and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
nine per one thousand births for infants of mothers who work in factories.
The injury to the State is apparent.</p>

<p>On the question of prevention of occupational diseases, I cannot do
better than quote the measures suggested by Dr. H. Linenthal, of Boston.
They are: collection of accurate data about working conditions; data
relative to the effect of occupation on mortality; proper medical instruction;
reporting to health authorities specific industrial diseases; examination
of all industrial workers; exclusion of minors and women from
certain industries; sanitary laws for factories; regulation of dangerous
trades by health authorities, and the carrying of an educational campaign
of hygiene among employers and employes. The comprehensiveness
of these measures indicates the extension of the problem. No movement
of recent times is more humane and economic than the one termed
industrial insurance.</p>

<p>The purpose is the capitalization of the workingman’s energy at the
time of his greatest productivity; the basic principle that every far-sighted
social policy is founded more on energy reserve than money
reserve. The aim is to secure for the nation the greatest possible reserve
of bodily and mental force and power and physical and moral health.</p>

<p>The problem has been attacked in various ways by different countries.
Germany has been the most successful. There the workingman’s insurance
has attained the dimension of a gigantic social institution. Dr.
Frederick Zahn of Munich, Director of the Bavarian Statistical Office,
in a recent address, gave the following interesting figures: Out of 16,000,000
laborers in Germany, 14,000,000 are carrying sick insurance, and
15,700,000 invalid and old age policies.</p>

<p>In the past twenty-five years over one billion six hundred million dollars
have been paid in benefits. In addition, prophylactic measures are
provided for.</p>

<p>Only those familiar with the necessities for correct data in health
work appreciate the immediate and imperative need for statistical information.
Records of births and deaths and of supplementary details form
a basis for advancement. Without such data, the sanitarian gropes in the
dark. Yet no request from the health department is so lightly treated.
Reform in this can be wrought slowly. Appropriations to pay registrars
and enforcement through the courts are the means for the inauguration
of a more perfect system.</p>

<p>One of the hygienic essentials in this country is education in the relative
values of food products. The phenomenal growth of the urban population
which has reduced the number of producers and the almost universal
practice of adulteration make imperative the enforcement of stringent
laws and instruction in the nutritive value of classes of foods and
the economy of selection.</p>

<p>The campaign for a supply of clean, pure milk in many centers has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
grown out of the effort to lower the infant mortality rate. It has stimulated
inquiry and supervision of other food products which is encouragingly
prophetic.</p>

<p>Hygiene in its application to personal and community life is essentially
preventive. This idea is not sufficiently understood to be taken at
its real value; curative measures the people commend, but possible
calamity seems remote, therefore, prevention does not appeal. It is this
concept of the collective mind that lies back of the extravagant parsimony
universal in health appropriations. It also explains public apathy
and indifference.</p>

<p>The most practical means for sanitary progress are two, education of
all the people in the primary truths of hygiene, and the application of
the science through governmental agencies. These are so closely related
that they are practically inseparable, but logically may be differentiated.</p>

<p>Hygiene is an organized science; its principles are rational and demonstrable;
its application will bring returns economic, ethical and spiritual.
This must be acceptably taught to the people by methods suited to
the present state of the public mind. Conviction that will lead to action
is the end to be sought. Education will create a public sentiment persistent
and insistent for measures promotive of public good. Concomitant
with this effort, in fact a part of it, the various units of government
should be executives in the establishment of hygienic measures and the
abolition of insanitary conditions. When people believe that the eradication
of typhoid fever and hookworm disease is more important than high
or low tariff; when they become convinced that malaria is a national
disgrace and uncleanliness a relic of barbarism, there will be money and
judicial decisions for the elimination of these defects.</p>

<p>Fortunately, these are the views of an increasingly large number of
people. There is a health awakening. The principles of the science of
health are every day becoming concrete in laws, and habits of thought
and living. It is the conviction of the progressive minority that a Nation’s
first duty is to conserve and protect its citizens, to develop a community
of efficient men and to minimize natural disadvantages. Further,
that collective intelligence must plan for the preservation of the people
and the perpetuity of the State, and in so doing must recognize public
health as fundamental, both in the simple phases and in its comprehensive
aspect. (Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The next subject to be discussed is by one who
employs labor in the State of Indiana, and who is a large employer of
labor. His subject is “The Duty of the Employer.” I now take pleasure
in introducing to you Dr. Edward A. Rumely, of Laporte, Indiana.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Duty of the Employer”</span></h3>
<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Rumely</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Four generations
ago, there were but three millions of Americans scattered along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
Atlantic Seaboard. Back of them was a vast virgin continent, the richest
the white man had ever found in the long migration upon which our race
started ages ago. The American continent was rich in timber, in the soil
fertility of its vast valleys and prairies, and rich beyond measure in the
superabundant deposits of mineral wealth. The first settlers were few in
number; they brought with them but few tools and little wealth that
today we would call capital. It was the natural and proper thing for
them to set to work to gain, with the least possible labor, the great natural
wealth that the virgin continent treasured for them.</p>

<p>They killed the fur-bearing animals, felled the trees to export lumber,
dug in the quickest way the mineral wealth of the land and started to
grow such crops as would carry to market the greatest value from the
fertility of the virgin prairies. Wheat was easily transported, and each
bushel contained from twenty to thirty cents of soil value. Hence with
wheat our prairies were taken under cultivation, and from the returns of
the wheat crops cities and railroads and homes were paid for.</p>

<p>Only today, when the average yield per acre has gone down from
forty to thirteen bushels are we beginning to see clearly that by this
process we have been drawing heavily upon our soil capital.</p>

<p>While the population was small, labor was difficult to secure. Cities
had to be built, roadways opened, railroads constructed, rivers bridged,
and a continent brought under subjection. The process of the past four
generations was possible only because our fathers economized their own
labor and created, as fast as possible, the values they needed to barter
off into the markets of the world for capital from the superabundant
natural wealth that surrounded them.</p>

<p>Today, we are mining our iron, copper, lead and other metals more
rapidly than any other country in the world. The pioneer farmers who
worked the soils of the south with tobacco and of the east with wheat,
can no longer move off to the west, when, having exhausted the fertility
of our lands, they find farming no longer profitable. The hundred thousand
vigorous Americans who went last year to Canada with energy, capital
and American tools are a concrete evidence that we have reached the
end of the course which we have been traveling.</p>

<p>The whole country has been startled by the warning of the far-sighted
men, and now the demand for conservation of our natural wealth is
becoming more and more insistent. We have been made to realize that
every child born brings a mouth that must be fed, a body that must be
sheltered and clothed, but no increase in natural wealth. We must still
learn that every child does bring two hands which can work, and which,
when highly trained and backed by scientific knowledge, can create untold
values. Stated otherwise, we must care for our increasing population,
not by increased exploitation of our natural stores, but by providing
abundant work for skilled labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span></p>


<p class="center">AMERICAN FARM MUST BE FACTORY—NOT A MINE.</p>

<p>Our agriculture has been a process of mining. The farm must now
furnish a field for the profitable employment of skilled labor, for the use
of capital, and the application of the principles of scientific management,
becoming thereby a workshop instead of a mine.</p>

<p>In order to sell the labor power of our people, we must encourage the
development of all secondary industries. By “secondary industries” I
mean those industries which take raw materials that are largely the
product of crude machinery and unskilled labor, and add to them in a
large measure labor and capital values.</p>

<p>The agricultural implement manufacturer purchases steel and iron at
approximately one cent per pound, and by further refinement creates
implements worth eight cents to twenty cents per pound. The automobile
maker takes lumber and iron, worth from two cents to four cents per
pound, and produces a car worth from thirty cents to one dollar per
pound, while the same materials, worked up into cash registers, typewriters,
etc., would be worth from $3 to $10 per pound, and in watches
from $50 to $5,000 per pound.</p>


<p class="center">CREATE VALUES FROM LABOR.</p>

<p>We began by cutting the maple tree into a cord of wood, worth from
three to seven dollars, and each tree furnished material for one day’s
work. This same tree—if sawed into lumber—is worth twenty dollars
and would furnish employment for one man for three or four days. If
quarter-sawed and more carefully treated, it might be worth forty dollars
and would furnish employment for more skilled and better paid
workers and for a period of from ten to twelve days. And this same
lumber, in a furniture factory would produce furniture worth from
$100 to $500 and would furnish employment directly and indirectly equal
to from six months to one year’s work for one man.</p>

<p>The whole range of values in this series, from the seven dollars’ worth
of cord wood or $500 worth of manufactured goods, depends upon the
degree of refinement extended to identically the same raw material
through the quality and quantity of labor employed upon it, the capital
expended and the application of greater scientific knowledge to the processes
of production.</p>

<p>The secondary industries that we must now begin to encourage are
characterized by a wide variety of work. They have different standards,
are not easily susceptible to organization on a large scale, and hence politically
have never acted as a concerted and effective force. The National
Association of Manufacturers has been held together largely by an
exaggerated emphasis upon the struggle against trades unionism. This
ideal of strife with labor is no longer sufficient, and many believe that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
much more can be gained by co-operating with labor to build up the
productive power of our people.</p>


<p class="center">SECONDARY INDUSTRIES AND CONSERVATION.</p>

<p>Today, the interests of the secondary manufacturer coincide closely
with the demands of the conservation movement, and with the best interest
of the Nation. The secondary manufacturer needs a permanent supply
of raw materials. It is to his interest to see that coal, lumber, iron,
electric power generated from our waterfalls, and every other raw material
of manufacture be permanently available at reasonable prices.
Where undue monopoly of the power of such raw materials exists, the
secondary manufacturer will be acting in accordance with his own enlightened
interests if he helps to restrict and regulate by political action.
Reckless exploitation, leading to exhaustion of any natural store, threatens
the very existence of his business.</p>

<p>In order to produce in large quantities, the secondary manufacturer
must sell into broad markets; must use freely and extensively the transportation
systems of the country. He realizes that the development of
railroading in the United States (which surpasses that of any other
country in the world, and has knit together a population of a hundred
millions with great buying and consuming power into one homogeneous
market) is one of our great national assets. On the basis of this broad
market, quantity manufacture can be developed as nowhere else in the
world.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—Before introducing the next speaker, I will read a
letter from Dr. Charles A. Doremus, of New York, whom we expected to
be here.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Letter from Mr. Charles A. Doremus</span></h3>
<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p style="text-align:right;">
<span class="smcap">New York</span>, September 30, 1912.</p>

<p>Mr. J. B. White, President of the Fourth National Conservation Congress:
</p>

<p>Dear Sir—Much to my regret I am prevented from attending the sessions
of the Congress, though appointed to represent, as a member of its Committee,
the American Electrochemical Society.</p>

<p>One of the matters detaining me is work in connection with the American
Museum of Safety, which is doing progressive work to conserve human life.
There are now twenty-two such museums and their beneficial influence is being
felt here and abroad. The large corporations have been enlisted in the work of
accident prevention and allied topics and the recent congresses, the Eighth International
Congress of Applied Chemistry and the International Congress of
Hygiene and Demography, have awakened great public interest in all that pertains
to the preservation of health and life.</p>

<p>May the Congress over which you have the distinguished honor to preside
still further enlist our people to safeguard not only our material wealth but the
people themselves.</p>

<p>I have the honor to be,</p>
<p class="pad40pc">Yours very respectfully,</p>
<p style="text-align:right;"><span class="smcap">Charles A. Doremus</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—I now have the pleasure of introducing to you Dr.
J. N. Hurty, of Indianapolis, President of the American Public Health
Association, and Indiana Health Commission, who will speak on “Conservation
of the Human Race.”</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Conservation of the Human Race”</span></h3>
<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hurty</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen:</p>

<p>High authority says we are only fifty per cent. efficient; that we live
out less than one-half the natural duration of life, that we consume twice
as much food as is needed to maintain efficient life, that we waste as
much as we use, and that one-half of all human beings born either die
before reaching maturity or fall into the defective, delinquent or dependent
classes. In these facts we find reasons why we waste the major portion
of all our resources and call it development. In these facts we find
reasons for the existence of robber taxation and predatory business. For,
a people who waste themselves, will, of course, waste their natural resources.
Therefore, the first, the most important, the fundamental conservation,
is the conservation of human efficiency. A people who cannot
be brought to a realization of the fact that they lead only half lives, and,
who realizing, will not end, will show the nations-to-come what fools the
present mortals were.</p>


<p class="center">LENGTH OF LIFE.</p>

<p>Length of life is a resultant of strength. “Honor thy father and thy
mother that thy days may be long in the land the Lord thy God giveth
thee.” It is an honor and it is a strength, for a nation to have a low sickness
and a low death rate with their consequent lengthened average duration
of life. In India, the average length of life is twenty-five years, in
the United States, forty, in England, forty, in Germany, forty-three and
in Sweden, forty-five. The natural duration is one hundred years.
Metchnikoff, after thirty years of study of disease and death says, only a
very few die natural deaths, most of mankind commit suicide. That is,
most people do not know how, or will not, conserve their vitality, and
thus results a greater or less period of disability and inefficiency with
premature death. Nature does no fooling, she has her laws and they are
enforced up to the handle.</p>


<p class="center">VITAL ASSETS.</p>

<p>Comparison of vital and physical assets as measured by earning power,
show that the vital are three to five times the physical. The facts
show that there is as great room for improvement in our vital resources
as in our lands, water, minerals and forests; and furthermore, this improvement
must come first for through human life only is natural conservation
possible. The dead past may bury the dead, but living and
strong men, not the weakly and sickly, must do the work of Conservation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span></p>


<p class="center">ILLNESS.</p>

<p>From our vital statistics, which constitutes the bookkeeping of humanity,
we learn that fully 100,000 people in Indiana are sick at all times,
25,000 of whom are consumptives. Not less than half of this is preventable,
and three-fourths may be prevented by strong effort. Eighteen
experts in various diseases as well as vital statisticians, have contributed
data on the ratio of preventability of the ninety different causes of death
into which mortality may be classified. From this data according to Fisher,
it is found that fifteen years at least could be at once added to the
average lifetime by practically applying the science of preventing disease.
More than half of this additional life would come from the prevention
of tuberculosis, typhoid fever and five other diseases, the prevention
of which could be accomplished by purer air, purer water and purer
milk. Let the business men, who are in the saddle and who run our
affairs, thoroughly consider this. They surely know that disease and
premature death are drags to business. Fifteen more years of life to
each citizen means an enormous increase in the strength and happiness
of the people, with consequent betterment to business.</p>

<p><em>Minor Ailments</em> must be thoroughly considered in any steps toward
the conservation of vitality. They are far more common and farther
reaching than is generally realized. They are chiefly functional disorders
such as of intestinal canal, heart, nerves, liver, kidneys, etc. These
disorders are gateways to the more serious disorders. Those who neglect
colds, or what seems to be colds, will prepare the tissues of the respiratory
tract for pneumonia and consumption.</p>

<p>Benjamin Franklin, wise and practical, successful as merchant, scientist,
and statesman, said—“The having of colds is a great drawback. I
notice when I have one my efficiency is greatly decreased. Thought,
judgment and understanding are clouded. Furthermore, I notice that
colds follow excess in eating and drinking and the much breathing of
bad air. They are quite unnecessary.” The losses due to mistakes in
business and in the general conduct of life on account of minor ailments
cannot be estimated except perhaps as time lost. A study of the matter
shows that the time lost cannot be less than four days annually to each
supposedly well man. Applying this to the wage earners of Indiana,
counting one wage earner to each five people, making 500,000 in all, and
we have to pocket an annual loss of 2,000,000 days or 5,470 years. In
dollars, counting the average wage at $500 per annum, the loss amounts
to $2,735,000 annually. This is certainly a prodigious loss to suffer in
Indiana because of minor ailments, all of which can practically be avoided
by proper public and private hygiene.</p>

<p>Neurasthenia, so common in the United States, is one of the most
serious and insidious introductions to grave disorders, which may be due<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
to depraved nutrition, to needless worry, or failure to have adequate recreation.</p>

<p><em>Patent Medicines.</em> A source of drug habit, ill health, disease, inefficiency
and race poisoning, militating against business is the horrible
patent medicines. Medicines at their best, given under skilled medical
direction are very dangerous things. (Applause.) The drug addicts,
made so by a certain kind of practitioners, by self doctoring, and the
taking of patent medicines, are numbered by hundreds of thousands. A
large proportion of drunkards are started on their way by taking tonics.
It is mostly the alcohol in tonics which produce the seeming improvement
and which give temporary relief, but which invariably make the last
state worse than the first. Alcohol, and all other drugs, are more dangerous
than dynamite, and trade in them should be restricted more
severely than trade in dynamite. (Applause.) The earth has been
ransacked for drugs to cure. Everywhere we see emblazoned advertisements
of medicines which the ad says will cure every disease from corns
and ingrowing toenail to syphilis and gonorrhea; and yet, sickness and
disease grow apace with our civilization. The world has been fine-combed
from the equator to the poles for a something with which to
bring health and prolong life; and lo, and behold, like the blue bird,
these blessings are in every household patiently waiting to be called. At
present, we are in the patent-medicine stage of ignorance, from which
we must emerge before real conservation of human life and energy can
be realized. (Applause.)</p>


<p class="center">SCHOOL HYGIENE.</p>

<p>In conserving vitality, the child must have physical defects removed
as far as possible, then he must be brought up amidst healthful surroundings
and itself trained in all that conserves health. This great State of
Indiana has already taken steps in this direction. The 67th General
Assembly ordained that the schoolhouses hereafter built shall be sanitary
in all particulars. This means, that waste of money and waste of child
strength and happiness, shall cease in this fair State so far as this one
matter goes. The same assembly has given permission to school authorities
to institute medical inspection of school children that they may be
relieved of morbid physical conditions which cause pain, inefficiency, illness
and early death. It was a marked forward step to grant this privilege
but it was a mistake of the Legislature in favor of loss of vitality not
to make this practical care of children compulsory. Physical strength is
the fundamental requirement for the making of children into educated
and moral citizens. There is now a world-wide movement led by Switzerland
and heathen Japan to save children and make them strong. A
Japanese physician traveling in this State said—“We have relatively
fewer short graves in our cemeteries.” The intelligence and business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
sense of a community could be accurately measured by determining its
relative number of short graves. Youth is the time to serve the Lord.
We must train the body in youth as well as the mind or the opportunity
to conserve vitality is largely lost. A far better business scheme than
securing more factories would be for the business men to turn their
attention to the conservation of human vitality. The returns would be
immense, failure to score in such an effort is impossible.</p>

<p>Hygiene has been permitted to extinguish cholera and yellow fever,
and by the grace of private benefaction it will soon banish hookworm
disease which now incapacitates 2,000,000 people in the South. And
may God hasten the business men to permit hygiene to banish those twin
leprosies, syphilis and gonorrhea, which are important factors in the
causation of insanity, crime, and pauperism, and which so fearfully
wreck the lives of so many innocent women and children as well as
wreck the lives of the guilty. (Applause.) Syphilis and gonorrhea are
responsible for the existence of a large proportion of defectives of various
kinds which fill our institutions. Let hygiene drive these plagues
away, and, Indiana, instead of building another insane hospital, for another
million dollars, which she must shortly do, could donate one of the
five now existent to educational use of some kind. (Applause.) I
strongly advise Indiana to listen to the health cranks if she wishes to
save health, time and money.</p>


<p class="center">SAVING VITALITY.</p>

<p>“<em>Strength, Endurance and Fatigue</em>, are the three great elements to
be considered in conserving life. The measure of strength is the force a
muscle can exert once, the measure of endurance is the number of times
it can repeat an exertion. Fatigue is caused by fatigue poisons, which
must be removed from the body during rest, principally during sleep.</p>

<p>Anything, therefore, which reduces strength and lessens endurance
and prevents removal of fatigue is inimical to vitality conservation.”</p>


<p class="center">SCIENCE OF LIVING.</p>

<p>The science of living begins at the mouth. Barring the taking of
drugs, as a man eats and digests his foods so he is. Owing to drug taking
and errors in human feeding, disease is latent in man at all times. Only
a few escape sickness and pain and die natural deaths. This is not as
nature would have it. Josh Billings, recovering from heart trouble
caused by the excessive use of tobacco said—“Nature made us all right,
we make fools of ourselves.” Other drugs which are of almost universal
use and which affect heart, nerves or efficient elimination are coffee, tea,
spices, cocaine, morphine, chloral and alcohol. (Applause.) All of these
are drugs, and all are poisons, and all more or less disturb the vital
functions, reducing vitality and efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>Any departure from unstimulated nutrition works harm. Stimulated
nutrition is unnatural, and perforce, is opposed to strength. Immoderate
eating—feasting and gluttony—reduce vitality and induce disease
with its consequent inefficiency. A very old adage says—“Most men
dig their graves with their teeth.” The old time author of this was
striving for the conservation of human vitality. Immoderate amounts of
nitrogenous foods, exemplified in white of egg and lean meats, cause
auto-intoxication. They do this by undergoing putrefaction in the digestive
tract, thus making toxins, which in turn being absorbed into the
body, cause the following train of ills which results in loss of vitality
and efficiency. Some of the auto-intoxication or over-eating ills, are—biliousness,
coated tongue, foul breath, clammy hands, clammy feet, dry
lusterless hair, putty complexion, dulled hearing, dulled vision, dulled
taste, dulled smell, early loss of memory, loss of continuous thought and
attention, headaches, vertigo, dyspepsia, loss of strength, rheumatism,
insomnia, fugitive pains and aches, hysteria, nervousness, nightmare,
irregular heart, shortness of breath, brittle nails, dry harsh skin, cancer
and premature old age of the doddering and slobbering kind. (Applause.)</p>

<p>Until we learn and practically apply the science of living we cannot
attain over 50 or 60 per cent. efficiency and must continue to live lives
of sickness, pain and disease, and die before the natural duration of life
has one-half expired; and if this does not hinder and delay the conservation
of natural resources nothing will.</p>

<p>“<em>Over-fatigue</em>, is a cause of loss of vitality. The present working
day from a physiological standpoint is too long. Over-work better expressed
by the term over-fatigue, starts a vicious circle leading to the
craving of means for deadening fatigue, thus inducing drug habits and
drunkenness.”</p>

<p>“Experiments in reducing the length of the working day show a
great improvement in the physical and mental efficiency of laborers and
results in an increased output sufficient to pay the difference. However,
the great justification of the shorter day is found in the interests of the
race and nation, not the employer. Public safety requires, in order to
avoid railway collisions and other accidents, the prevention of long hours;
lack of sleep and undue fatigue is quite as great as the waste from serious
illness. A typical succession of events is, first, fatigue, then “colds,”
then tuberculosis, then death. In order to prevent in the beginning this
increasing line of destructive agencies, undue fatigue must be prevented.”</p>


<p class="center">HEREDITY.</p>

<p>Vitality largely rests upon inherited qualities. A child born of weak
parents, those parents having received their weakness by inheritance, will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
itself be weak in the same way. Idiots breed idiots. Whatever improvement
the child may enjoy, must rest upon its inherited foundation. If a
child inherits brown eyes they must stay brown, no amount of cultivation
may change their color, but inherited weak sight may be improved to a
greater or less degree. Two forces, therefore, control vitality, namely,
conditions preceding birth and conditions during life. In other words,
the foundations of vitality are wholly inherited, and may be cultivated
to the degree the inherited foundations will permit.</p>

<p>A perfectly sound physical and mental inheritance is rare and is the
greatest of all assets. The highest development of a nation will begin
when the human law conforms to God’s law of development and parenthood
is denied to defectives. Prisons and asylums are now sufficiently
numerous, as it is evidence of defectiveness of the masses to conduct
our affairs so as to necessitate their increase. Indiana now has five great
insane asylums, each representing about one million dollars, and there
are enough insane in jails, poorhouses and in homes to fill another one.
Our population increased 16 per cent. in the last decade and insanity
increased 29 per cent. There is a business problem for you.</p>

<p>To go along in the future as in the past, permitting, even fostering
the production of the hereditary insane, of the hereditary pauper and
criminal, of the hereditary idiot and feeble-minded, and then building
great palaces in parks to care for them, will mean we have not the
common horse-sense necessary for the proper conduct of our affairs.
(Applause.)</p>


<p class="center">HYGIENE.</p>

<p>We must look to hygiene, the science of health, to conserve human
vitality. The term includes every necessary force to prevent disease, to
increase strength and endurance, and to prevent the production of the
unfit.</p>

<p>The ponderous and oppressively costly courts have been grinding
for centuries and crime increases. Punishment and fear of punishment
restrain evil doing, but does not eradicate the tendency to evil.
This and other defects we must, as far as possible breed out of the race,
and science can find a valid answer for every objection which obstructionists
can raise to this proposition. Fostering insanity, crime, pauperism
and imbecility, is not evidence of understanding and of high ability.</p>

<p>The divisions of hygiene are: Federal, State, Municipal, Institutional,
School, Domiciliary and Personal.</p>

<p>Hygiene not only makes for greater physical strength and endurance
but it makes for greater moral strength. It is the essence of charity,
kindliness, patience and truth.</p>

<p>When, through hygiene, defectives, delinquents and dependents are
no longer propagated, when simplicity and frugality of living are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
achieved, voluntary celibacy and voluntary childlessness will become
discreditable, and sickness, disease and premature death will disappear
before temperance and sanitized homes.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—This admirable paper causes me to say to every
one here that they cannot afford to go away and not deposit a dollar
with the Secretary for the book of the Proceedings of this Congress.
The book of these admirable and practical addresses should be in every
home, should be in the library. I hope that every one will leave their
address, will register, and receive as soon as they are published a copy
of the Proceedings. (Applause.)</p>

<p>It was Louis D. Brandeis who said a year or two ago that the railroads
of this country could save a million dollars a day with practical
economy and with good system. He got that idea from and quoted
Mr. Harrington Emerson of New York City, who will now address this
audience upon “The Rescue of the Fit.”</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Rescue of the Fit”</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Emerson</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: There is a
growing clash between employer and employe. The old order is passing
away and the new order has not yet come in. The millions lost in
strikes are forever wasted. This direct waste due to supposed conflict
of interest is one of the great losses. The other is more serious. Not
one man in ten is in the place in the world best fitted for him, not one
place in ten is filled by the best man in the world for the job. When
the job is not bossed by the right man and when the man is on the
wrong job there is a waste whose magnitude is incalculable. It is
to mitigate, palliate, obviate, these two great sources of waste that on a
large scale a new plan is being put into operation. The theory that
underlies it is founded on principles, not on empiricism or on tradition
or on rule of thumb.</p>

<p>It is theory that has given us the best designs for steam turbines, gas
engines, dynamos, aeroplanes—it is theory that gives us this plan of the
<em>Employment Department</em>.</p>

<p>What is the theory?</p>

<p>All manufacturing costs fall under three divisions: Materials,
Labor, Equipment Charges.</p>

<p>Materials means all materials, whether for manufacture or operation.</p>

<p>Labor means all personal service or personal charges, whether direct,
indirect, supervising or managing.</p>

<p>Equipment charges are made up of taxes, insurance, depreciation and
interest on investment.</p>

<p>Although these three classes of expense are so different there are some
general economic laws which apply to all of them and it is quite certain
that what we have learned to accept as to materials, may have some
lessons applicable to personal service and to equipment charges. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
our building materials consisted of prairie sod the problem was simple,
we picked out the best sod in sight, plowed it up, hauled it to one side
and erected it into walls. When the task is to build an automobile the
handling of materials is not so simple.</p>

<p>In automobile plants the engineering department designs what is
wanted, then draws up specifications, precise and scientific specifications;
steel that will test under tension or torsion so many thousand
pounds, steel balls, that are so round, so hard, so even in size, bronze,
that is so resistant, copper that is so pure, etc.</p>

<p>The purchasing department then calls for tenders or for bids. Samples
or specimens are submitted for test and these go into the testing
laboratory where they must come up to specifications. The purchasing
agent says: How good a wire can you sell me for $0.10 a pound?
What will the price be on wire testing 200,000 pounds?</p>

<p>The materials having been tested and bought are put into the storehouse
under a competent storekeeper. It is his business to see that
they do not spoil, that they are not wasted or stolen. He issues only
on requisition, the requisition specifying the proper quality and quantity.
When the materials go into use they are continually inspected
during the progress of the work.</p>

<p>There is therefore an inspection department. Engineers have learned
that it is not the price of materials that counts but the quality. As
quality goes up quantity goes down and price goes up but not as fast
as quality. Although steel wire is dear and cast iron is cheap, we build
bridges out of steel wire. Although we can buy carbon steel for $0.14
a pound, we pay $0.60 a pound for high speed alloy steel because it
works faster and so much more powerfully that it would be cheap at
$800 a pound if we could not get it for less.</p>

<p>As to complex modern materials we need therefore an engineering
department to design and specify, a testing department to test and
analyze, a purchasing department to buy at the best price and on the
best terms, an inspection department to watch results from day to day,
hour to hour; a storekeeping department to hold and to conserve, to
issue carefully and economically.</p>

<p>Modern personal service is more complex than modern materials.
How can we afford to omit as to personal service any of the safeguards
found necessary as to materials? These necessary safeguards we apply
through a very highly organized employment department directed and
managed by specialists of the higher class and a corps of assistants.</p>

<p>In the employment department all these methods so necessary as to
materials, we apply also to personal service control, whether we are
securing a factory superintendent or a shoveler of sand. First of all
an organization is outlined. It is evident that to perform certain kinds
of tasks there is only one best organization. Battleships are a modern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
development, they have been slowly evolved. America started it when
the Confederate Government sheathed the Merrimac with railroad rails
and sank all the wooden ships. As the London Times editorially said,
“The Merrimac made all the navies of the world obsolete.” Great
Britain, Germany, France, Italy, have helped develop battleships, but
the organization controlling every battleship in the world, whether
Japanese, Chinese, Russian, Turkish, Chilean or American, is substantially
the same. An American officer could be transferred to a foreign
navy and find himself at once. Naval organizations the world over are
interchangeable. The ordinary manufacturing concern has no standardized
organization, it has generally grown like Topsy. Positions are ill
defined and generally worse manned. The first duty, therefore, of a
modern employment department is to outline the organization, the one
best organization for the business in hand.</p>

<p>Its second duty is to specify the essential and required qualities for
each position.</p>

<p>There are three different ways of filling positions:</p>

<p>1. To have on one’s hands some incubus, a king’s son or a king’s
mistress or some political henchman, and to create a position for the
incubus to fill, “duke of this” or “countess of that,” or a fat contract
on city work. In England this is called “finding a berth for a friend”—<em>a
berth—a place in which to fall asleep</em>.</p>

<p>2. The second way, and the more usual one, is to see a real vacancy
and to shove a friend into it, hoping he will make it a go. The man
and the job stand as good a show of fitting each other as a man would
of getting the right clothes by drawing a suit in a raffle. It was Roosevelt
who saw a vacancy in the Presidency, grabbed Mr. Taft, shoved
him into the place, and now declares he does not fit. Personal liking
is not the proper basis for a Presidential preference.</p>

<p>3. The third way to fill a definite vacancy is to find the man fitted
for the place, and, after test, put him into it, even as we find a suitable
wire for a bridge and put it in.</p>

<p>If we have a locomotive of definite design and we need an exhaust
nozzle, there is only one design of nozzle that will answer. So if in
the organization there is a position to fill, the best man for that position
must have certain qualities and not have others, not every man, not
the convenient man in ten, probably not one man in ten thousand is the
man for the place. The employment department seeks diligently for the
right man, the man who combines experience with aptitude. If it had
to choose it would prefer the man without experience but with all the
aptitudes to the man of experience without aptitudes. The man with
aptitudes can learn quickly, reliably and fast; the man without aptitudes
can never be anything but a misfit. Therefore the employment department<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
having secured a number of prospects, carefully tests the most
promising.</p>

<p>The old-fashioned plan is to ask a few questions, secure a few recommendations,
take a look at the man, and if a hunch is felt that he will
do, accept him. I know all about this plan, for I have tried it for twenty
years, and in some years it has cost me $50,000. The plan does not
work. I received the best set of recommendations I ever saw about a
sea captain, and when we entrusted him with a $140,000 steamer he
deliberately wrecked her in order to make some graft out of the repair
bills.</p>

<p>That the man was a scoundrel was written in large type all over
his face, but in those days I could not read plain print and I was better
fitted, and that was <em>not at all</em>, to navigate the steamer than to select
a captain.</p>

<p>When I taught in college I got an inkling of the right way. I taught
German, and at the beginning of the year my classes were filled up
with sixty students, and at the end of the year there were only twenty
left. I worked on the theory that there was no profit to any one in
making a bluff at studying German. It was either worth while or it was
not. If worth while, learn German; if not worth while, don’t waste time
on it. So I weeded and weeded my German garden until only those
were left who could really learn. They learned to know German as
well as they knew English. The weeding process was hard on me and
hard on the misfits, hard on the good students. I gave an immense
amount of rough effort to no purpose in an absolutely useless attempt
to make silk purses out of sows’ ears. Then sows’ ears might have
made good mince meat, but the carving and slashing I gave them hurt
them to no purpose. My time was taken up on rough work until the
misfits and the good students failed to receive the specially skilled
attention and help their progress required. After a couple of years of
this I tried a new plan. It was evident that any students who did not
know English, English grammar, English spelling, English pronunciation,
were not fit to study German, so I examined all applicants as to
English, but I gave those who failed a week’s test, lest some genius
should by chance be overlooked. I never found the genius. Under this
plan I started out with a class of twenty-five instead of sixty. I gave
my time to those who could profitably make use of it, and not to those
who could not, and every one of the twenty-five learned German.</p>

<p>A man or woman can be tested in five minutes for fundamental
aptitudes and traits of character as easily and reliably as I tested the
prospective German pupils. It would take one too far to go into the
whole subject of character analysis. A great composer like Mozart,
Beethoven, Wagner, can originate music, but there are thousands who
can learn to play it well. So with character analysis. It requires a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
special and rare gift to uncover the lessons written in the coloring, in
the texture, in the shape of head, in the expression of the face, of the
body, of the hands, in the clothes, in the personal tricks of habit, to
cross-check these tests by others as the answers to test questions, but
this knowledge has been so formulated that all can learn. So instead
of trying to play bumbly puppy by ourselves, of missing the accumulated
researches that have been going on all over the world, of repeating
all the mistakes that others have made, we do as the Japanese did when
they adopted the British navy, the German army and the American
schools as models. We are advised as to our employment department by
a specialist of the highest skill in character analysis, in all problems
relating to the handling of people. The tests are rapid but they are
many and they interlock so far as to be conclusive. A man can lie with
his eyes or with his lips or with his body, but no man is skillful enough
to lie at the same time with eyes and lips and hands and body.</p>

<p>After men have been tested they are employed, not before, and they
are only employed because they have the qualities that fit them for a
particular place. They may be at the time only 30 p. c. men, they
may be succeeding an 80 p. c. man, but the great fact is that the 30 p. c.
man can and will become a 100 p. c. or a 110 p. c. man, while the 80
p. c. man is perhaps in reality an overstrained 70 p. c. man. Starting
with the best of human material years are not lost gradually collecting
it. Not only are the unfit excluded, but what is very much more important,
the <em>fit are rescued</em>, they are given opportunity, they jump at
once into the places they can fill instead of waiting for years.</p>

<p>What is the unnecessary cost to a business of a 30 p. c. man compared
to a 100 p. c. man?</p>

<p>The hourly costs of a man are: His hourly wage, the hourly machine
charge, the hourly overhead charge. These three items will easily
average $0.70 an hour in a machine shop. If the man works at full
efficiency he gives us in a year 2,700 hours of standard work in 2,700
hours of actual time at a total cost of $1,890. At 30 p. c. efficiency, it
will take 9,000 actual hours, costing $6,300 to deliver 2,700 hours of
standard work. The added expense due to inefficiency is $4,410 for a
single worker.</p>

<p>Efficiency does not mean strenuousness. The fluttering rooster is
strenuous, but he makes little progress; the eagle flies efficiently, covering
miles of country, yet never moving a wing. The Chinese coolie on his
river treadmill is so strenuous that he wears himself out in a few years.
As a producer of power he costs $1,300 a year for the horse-power hour
you can buy from Niagara for twenty dollars. The chauffeur of an
American automobile gliding along at forty miles an hour, carrying six
passengers, is efficient, not strenuous.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span></p>

<p>It is evident that under this modern employment plan the rate of
wages per hour ceases to be a critical question. The efficient man, like
steel wire and high-speed steel, is always worth more than he would think
of asking for his services.</p>

<p>The requisition calls for a man with certain qualities—it never calls
for a man at $0.20 or at $0.30 or at any other rate per hour. Fixed
rates per hour are obsolescent when one man turns out the work for
$6,300 and the other man turns it out for $1,890. For $1,890? No,
he does not. We do not ask him to; we can not secure and hold any 100
p. c. man for the wage rate in the $1,890. We pay the man more,
we gladly pay him more, we pay him as much as we must to secure him,
but he is cheap at almost any price.</p>

<p>The man who receives a salary of $60,000 a year is expected to profit
his company to the extent of $6,000,000 a year; the man who works for
a dollar a day is always a loss, a severe loss, and, therefore, we try
to eliminate him by the substitution of a machine. The fight against a
machine is to carry on a losing fight against the whole current of the
age. To put the worker in a position for which his aptitudes qualify
him is to double, treble his value, and everybody is best fitted for something.
A group of children were playing automobile; one was the engine,
another the chauffeur, others the passengers. A little tot far behind
was hurrying along. What are you doing? I am playing automobile.
What part are you? I am the smell. In a watch there is not
a useless piece. In a perfected organization there is not a useless man;
there cannot be an unqualified man without endangering the whole.
As I write, 20,000 mill hands are rioting at Lawrence, Massachusetts,
because somebody has blundered, because some position had been badly
filled.</p>

<p>The wage question is ethical. The workman is worthy of his
hire, but also man does not live by bread alone. The man scientifically
selected is 100 per cent. efficient because he likes his work, is fitted for
it and it likes him; it is no longer a drudgery, it is a pleasure. We are
rescuing the fit for the work which by nature’s right belongs to them
and under this plan there are few unfit.</p>

<p>In years gone by when a beef was slaughtered much of the carcass
was wasted—the horns, the bones, the hair, the hoofs, the blood, the
offal went to waste. Now nothing is wasted; everything has its use, and
the offal we return as fertilizer to the soil is of greater perennial use
than the tenderloins and sirloins which find their way to the tables of
the rich.</p>

<p>We have in the past treated men as if they were coal, a raw product
only fit to burn, or as the German soldiers pathetically called themselves,
in 1870, mere cannon fodder. But mere coal contains ammonia, beautiful
dyes, strange and powerful medicines, as well as heat units.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>Everybody is normally good for something, and if fitted to the right
place is worth more than he now is.</p>

<p>At Seattle a boy of 17 was excluded from the high school because
he could not learn their lists of English kings or American Presidents,
but that boy went out and when I met him he had grabbed the evaporative
power of the sun and was propelling a boat with it on the waters
of Puget Sound. He was fit, more fit in a mechanical way than any other
boy I ever knew.</p>

<p>It is to this Rescue of the Fit that I look forward for the great uplift
of American industries, the great increase in happiness and the great
elimination of strife.</p>

<p>It is being put to a practical test in a plant employing 200 men and
it is working.</p>

<p>This is my message to you.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—There is nothing further on the program for this
afternoon, and we will therefore adjourn until 8:00 o’clock this evening,
when Dr. Wallace and Judge Lindsey will speak in Tomlinson Hall.</p>


<hr class="r5">

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="SIXTH_SESSION"><a href="#contents"><em>SIXTH SESSION.</em></a></h2>
</div>


<p>The Congress assembled at Tomlinson Hall, at 8:00 o’clock p. m.,
and was called to order by President White.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The delegates, visitors and citizens of this city
have a rare treat in store tonight in the program that has been published,
and I have a rare honor in introducing the speakers. It will be a red-letter
day in my life, and I know it will be in yours.</p>

<p>I now want to make this audience acquainted with “Uncle Henry”
Wallace. I would be glad if everyone could know “Uncle Henry” as
I have been fortunate enough to know him. He has been an inspiration
to every young man and every farmer and all who have known him in
the State of Iowa for the past twenty-five or thirty years. He loves
to sit down in his office, or study—and I have been there to see how he
works—answering letters that the farmers from all over the country
write him, and who look to “Wallace’s Farmer” as a source of profit
and information upon every subject that affects the home. He comes
close to the home, close to the family, to the fireside, answering all their
questions and telling them just how they should do this or that, and all
in that fatherly, kindly, brotherly way, so that he is referred to by
everyone who knows him as “Uncle Henry.” He is going to talk to us
tonight upon “Human Efficiency,” and he will speak from a very practical
standpoint, for he has had experience all along the line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span></p>

<p>I now take pleasure in introducing to you Dr. Henry Wallace, of
Des Moines, Iowa, former President of the National Conservation
Congress. (Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Human Efficiency”</span></h3>
<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>—Mr. President, and Members of the Congress: It
might not be amiss, before entering into a discussion of the subject
proper, to recall the different subjects which have from year to year
engaged the attention of the Conservation Congress, and to show how
the choice of the subject for each different Congress was the natural
and logical result of the discussion of the preceding Congress.</p>

<p>The first Congress was called, and the Congress itself was organized,
as a forum in which the leading men of the Nation could discuss the
problems raised by the Conservation Commission, appointed by Theodore
Roosevelt at the suggestion of Gifford Pinchot, then holding the
position of Chief Forester in the Department of Agriculture. His
position as Forester enabled him to see the terrific waste going on in the
management of our forests, and the various means by which the government
forests were passing into the hands of individuals, subsequently
to be wasted for private gain. He saw clearly that unless our forests
were conserved and managed as are the forests of all other civilized
nations, soil erosion would render future forest growth impossible, would
fill our rivers with silt, dry up the streams in summer and convert them
into raging torrents in winter, depriving us of water for irrigation, and
diminishing in value the water power, or white coal, on which future
generations must largely depend for power and transportation.</p>

<p>A forum was greatly needed in which the questions raised by this
fearless idealist—to whom the Conservation of our resources for future
generations is both wife and child—could be openly and fearlessly discussed
by leaders and in the hearing of the American people. When
the First Conservation Congress was called to meet in Seattle in 1909,
naturally the main topic for discussion was the Conservation of the forests
and of the water powers, which were then fast passing into the hands
of great corporations.</p>

<p>By this time the public conscience was aroused. The people of the
United States began to see clearly that we dare not go on in the future,
looting and wasting our natural resources as we had done in the past.
They began to realize that the generations of the unborn had rights in
the oil, the coal and other minerals in that portion of the public domain
that we had not as yet recklessly thrown away, or allowed to be
stolen from us under forms of or in defiance of law. So the Second
Conservation Congress was called in St. Paul, in 1910, as a forum in
which the leading men of the nation could thresh out the problem as to
whether these resources to which the American people at present held
title should be administered by a Congress chosen by the people and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
speaking for the people, or whether they should be administered through
an act of Congress by the several States in which the Government property
happened to be located.</p>

<p>The historian of the future alone will be able to measure the beneficial
results of the fierce conflict between those who would despoil these
resources for private gain and those who would conserve them for future
generations. We can, however, see some of the results in the change in
the policy of our national administration, in the vigilant watch now
maintained by the present Secretary of the Interior; by the success
which crowned the efforts of Mr. Pinchot and others who kept constant
watch over bills intended, by means of concealed jokers, to break down
the fixed policy of the Government; and by the veto of the President
of vicious bills which, notwithstanding the utmost vigilance, were enacted
by the last Congress. This watch and guard over the heritage of
the unborn could not have been maintained successfully, had it not been
for the white light thrown upon the problem by the Second National
Conservation Congress.</p>

<p>I was, unexpectedly to myself, chosen President of the Conservation
Congress at the close of the St. Paul meeting; and with the consent and
advice of my executive committee, in making out the program for the
1911 meeting in Kansas City, fixed the attention of the American people
on the necessity for the Conservation of the fertility of the soil, and
the development of a better social and family life among the tillers of
the soil.</p>

<p>The time had come for the American people to understand that the
rapid and regular advance in the cost of living was due mainly to
the terrific waste of the fertility of the soil, that had been going on
for more than a hundred years. It was time for the farmer to learn
that he was not in a position to throw stones at the lumberman who had
wasted our forests, or at the mine owner who is wasting one-third of the
coal in the process of mining; that he, while a sharer in the cheapness of
the products of forest and mine, had himself been mining the fertility
of the soil, stored for his benefit through countless ages, and selling
it at the bare cost of mining; and in doing so had built up cities the
world over, which must cry for bread when the fertility of his soil became
exhausted.</p>

<p>It is too early yet to measure the full results of this Kansas City
Congress. This should be noted, however, that, whether the result of
the discussions of this Congress or not, the people of the United States
have shown an interest in agriculture and the maintenance of soil fertility
which they had never shown before. Bankers, railroad officials,
capitalists are beginning to see that unless the farmer receives encouragement
and efficient aid, this nation will soon cease to be a factor in
supplying other nations with food, and will gradually become a consuming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
instead of a producing country, so far as the products of the
soil are concerned. We are beginning to see that unless a more satisfactory
social life is established in the open country, the increasing disparity
between rural and urban population must continue and the cost
of living must go on increasing, and with it increasing discontent and
social disturbance.</p>

<p>My successor and his executive committee, with their wide experience
in practical affairs, saw clearly that if we are to restore fertility to our
wasted soils, if we are to do anything worth while for the Conservation of
our resources of any kind or character, there must be an increase in the
efficiency of the individual. They therefore wisely chose the subject of
“Vital Resources” as the main center around which discussion must
revolve at the present Conservation Congress.</p>

<p>The subject of Vital Resources opens up a very wide field for investigation
and discussion. Various subjects in the group have been
discussed and others will be, by specialists who have given their particular
subject years of conscientious and close study. So when only
last week I was urged to make this address instead of discussing a minor
phase of the subject, there was nothing left for me but a general discussion
of the subject of Human Efficiency.</p>

<p>Man, after all, is the biggest thing on this planet. The farm people
are always bigger than the farm. No matter how rich by nature
the farm may be, it will lose fertility if the farmer is not big enough.
The first-class farmer will take an inferior piece of land and in time
bring it up to his own measure. If the farmer does not fit the farm,
it will in time come up to or decline to his measure. The average production
of the soil is the expression of nature’s opinion of the fitness of
the man who tills it for a term of years. The most severe condemnation
of the American farmer is the fact that, with some of the richest soils
in the world, he has so wasted its fertility that he is crying out for commercial
fertilizers; while the “heathen Chinee” has farmed for at
least forty centuries, and has maintained his soil fertility without the
use of commercial fertilizers.</p>

<p>If any great business has attracted attention by its success, one
always asks: Who’s the man or men behind it? The greatness of this
nation is measured not by its soil, its mines, its forests, its water powers,
but by the efficiency of its people. This is true of all nations. The cynical
Bismark, who always cast covetous eyes on Holland, is said once
to have remarked that the way to redeem Ireland was to transport the
Dutch to the Emerald Isle and transport the Irish to Holland; that
the Dutch would make Ireland an earthly Paradise, while the Irish
would not keep up the dikes except with the help of the Germans, who
would in that case soon have a seaport.</p>

<p>The only way by which you can restore the wasted fertility of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
soil and the waste of our forests and develop properly our mineral
resources; the only way in which we can as a nation take the place to
which we are entitled—that of leader in the world’s trade and commerce—is
by increasing to the utmost limit human efficiency, physical,
mental and moral. These three are ineradicably linked together, because
they are integral parts of every human being. We can not develop
fine human beings physically without the development of the intellect
and the soul; nor can we develop either the intellectual or the
moral to the limit without taking care of the body.</p>

<p>If we are to have the maximum of efficiency in the man, the child
must be well born, must be free from incurable diseases, mental, moral
or physical. To every generation of human beings is given by an allwise
Ruler the power to foreordain the character and quality of the generation
to come. The coming generation is as helpless in our hands as clay
in the hands of the potter. By marriage parents decree the personality
of their children. By “personality” I mean the inherent tendencies—physical,
mental and moral—which, when developed wisely or unwisely,
make or mar the character. In that little pink lump of humanity—the
pride of the father and the joy of the mother—are bound up in various
combinations the incidents, passions and capacities of the parents. It
is this which gives its awful sacredness and tremendous possibilities to
marriage.</p>

<p>The State by the extent to which it discourages and represses vice
and crime, by the extent to which it prevents and controls disease, by
the extent to which it encourages the marriage of the fit and prevents
the marriage of the unfit, foreordains the character of the next generation.
I know that I am approaching ground but little trodden, in which
many fear to tread, and to tread on which is by many deemed sacrilege.
But if we are to be a virile nation, strong in body, in intellect and in
morals, the truth must be told fearlessly; and there is no more fitting
place to tell it than where the people of this Congress are making a study
of our vital resources.</p>

<p>To put the matter with brutal frankness: The State must soon
determine whether the hardened criminal shall be allowed to take an
active part in foreordaining the character of future generations; whether
the manifest degenerate, whether that degeneracy be the result of being
badly born or of vice or crime, shall be allowed to breed degenerates;
whether those afflicted with incurable and transmissible disease shall be
allowed to transmit them to a helpless posterity.</p>

<p>In order that the State may act wisely, it is time for a most thorough
and searching investigation of existing conditions, material and
moral, which lead to crime; the extent to which criminal tendencies are
transmissible—criminal tendencies, mark you, for crime itself is not
transmissible; what proportion of our crimes are due to intemperance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
and to what extent the unbalanced state of mind which makes self-control
impossible, and leads to crime, is due to inheritance. It will no
longer do to say as some do: that intemperance, by killing off the unbalanced
and weakling, rids society of an encumbrance; nor that nameless
diseases weed out of the race those unable to maintain self-control.
While all this is in a certain sense true, it furnishes no argument for
abating zeal in repressing these crimes against humanity. That terrible
saying of Anne of Austria: “God does not pay at the end of every
week, but at last He pays,” finds striking illustration in the fate that
sooner or later befalls the intemperate and the impure.</p>

<p>On one subject there is no need of any investigation. We must either
adopt such measures as will insure as far as possible that the coming
generation shall be well born, or we will compel our posterity to pay the
price, as we are paying it now. We stand before the world today convicted
of having more murders, more suicides and far more lynchings in
proportion to our population, than any other civilized nation on the face
of the globe; and also with having, speaking generally, by far the most
corrupt city governments. Is it not time for us to investigate and see
why we thus stand condemned in the eyes of the nations, and to what
extent we are breeding crime, the crime that is our disgrace? For be
assured that we must in all cases pay the price, not in cold cash alone,
but in blasted lives and ruined homes and a lower degree of human
efficiency. If we are to be a great nation, worthy of our blood inheritance
and worthy of our material resources, our children must be well-born.</p>

<p>If we are to secure that measure of human efficiency that will enable
us to make full use of our inheritance, whether of blood or material
resources, we should see to it that the coming generation is not merely
well born, but well fed. The farmer is wise in that he takes special care
of the young things that come on his farm. He builds a lamb creep, that
the young lamb may get feed denied its dam. He sorts his pigs into
convenient sizes, and shuts them out of the feeding places until the feed
is properly placed, and then lets them all in at once, so that they may
all have equal opportunity. He does not allow the weanling colt to take
its chance with the selfish and unprincipled horses in the stalk field. He
protects his colts and gives them food “convenient” for them. If an
unruly beast in his stock yard tyrannizes the young and robs them of
their food, he does the sensible thing. He dehorns the unruly. He will
tolerate no oppression about his farm. In this he is wise; wise, because
he knows that if he fails to do this, the red flag of the sheriff will sooner
or later stand above his door, and the farm will be sold to some man
who will handle it more wisely.</p>

<p>The State has a similar responsibility for taking care of the young.
Whatever may be their endowment by nature, that is, by birth, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
need the nurture which is necessary to bring out and develop fully the
gifts of nature. The State should smite anything that stands in the
way of the proper nurture or feeding of the young. If the State is to
prosper, it must protect the weak against the encroachments of the
strong; and of all classes, the children of the State need its protection
most.</p>

<p>If organized capital provides so little pay for labor, that the laboring
man can not properly feed his children, then the State should dehorn
that organized oppressor, as the farmer dehorns the unruly bull or boss
cow. No profits to the individual or the organization, even though they
be members of the State, can compensate for the robbery of the children
of the State. If the State on investigation finds that the money that
should purchase food for the young goes into the till of the publican,
then the State should smite the publican in its wrath—not the individual
publican, who perhaps may feel that he is earning his bread in the
only way for which he is fitted, but the system which makes it necessary
for the prosperity of the producer of intoxicating liquors, to corrupt so
many hundred of our youth for every thousand dollars of invested
capital. (Applause.)</p>

<p>If we have a system existing, whether in the State or the Nation,
which can thrive only on the debauchery of the young and on the robbery
of the child, by taking that which should go for food to support it,
then it is time that the State and the Nation should control it to a point
where it can neither seduce the young or rob the child; and that point
is suppression. We must do that or do worse, namely, pay the price.
We are in fact paying that now. The individual who will not keep account
of his expenses is in danger of bankruptcy, no matter how great
his resources; and the State which refuses to count the cost of any institution
or system which tends to debauch morals, and corrupt the young,
is on the way to destruction. For there is no avoiding the payment of
the cost, whether we keep account or not; and that cost is not merely the
dollars and cents, but starved children, blasted lives, broken hearts,
ruined homes, increase of poverty and an increase of criminality, which
is beyond the possibility of mathematics to compute. The State can afford
to tolerate nothing whatever that stands in the way of proper nurture
of the young; nor can it safely endure anything which tends to dwarf
them physically, mentally or morally. (Applause.)</p>

<p>The State, however, will always succeed best by removing the causes
that lead to improper nurture, or to the formation of vicious or criminal
habits. The State can not endure poverty, grinding poverty, among
any class of its people; nor can it endure having its children poorly
housed. The slum is the enemy of the State and of every citizen of the
State. The vice and crime of the slum reach out to the west end or the
east end or the avenue, or wherever the wealthy and prosperous congregate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
thus saying to all men: We are brothers. The poverty-stricken
may well say: If you will not give us our rights, if you grind our faces,
we will not merely levy toll on your pocketbooks, but we will infect you
with our vices.</p>

<p>If we are to have the highest efficiency in the next generation, the
State (and by the State I mean the government, whether State or National)
must see to it that infancy is protected from the abominations
of soothing syrup, and “sleep-easy,” that usurp the place of the catnip
tea and other herbs which soothed infantile pains in the days of our
grandmothers. It is useless to expect efficiency, if we pour into the
innocent lips of unsuspecting childhood the habit-forming drugs which
benumb the brain, stifle sensibility, and lay the foundation for incurable
vices when the babe has grown to manhood. Let us get back to the
ideals of the ancient psalmist, who, contemplating the future of the
chosen people, uttered the prayer that “our sons shall be as plants
grown up in their youth, and our daughters as cornerstones fashioned
after the similitude of a palace.” That is, a plant carefully cultivated,
spreading freely, its roots drawing sustenance from the soil beneath,
its leaves drawing sustenance from the air and sunshine, bracing itself
against the storm; the daughters the cornerstones of the home, with all
the adornment that we bestow on a palace fit for the abode of royalty.
Let us go back to this ancient ideal, if we are to be a happy people,
whose God is Jehovah.</p>

<p>If we are to maintain human efficiency, the State must lay a heavy
hand on the venders of impure food. After what Dr. Wiley has told
you, there is no need for me to enlarge on this cause of inefficiency.
Suffice it to say, there was a time in the memory of some of the older
men, when there was no pure food question. Our oatmeal, our cornmeal,
our flour came from our own farms. There was no shorts in our
buckwheat, no white earth in our flour. If our meats were tainted, it
was due to our own negligence. In these latter days we have become
by force of circumstances more completely “members one of another,”
drawing our food from all parts of the habitable earth; and hence
the State must protect us from imposition. If we are to reap the benefits
which come from the modern system of division of labor, we must
not quibble about the expense involved in enforcing honesty in those
who feed us.</p>

<p>If we are to have efficiency in the generation now entering upon
the stage, or in the one to follow, we will need to make radical changes
in our system of education. No matter what the natural endowment,
it will be comparatively inefficient unless properly developed.
Education does not consist of putting in but of drawing out. Culture
is simply the proper development of the gifts of nature. All children are
born with the capacity for doing, and doing well, some small part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
the work that needs to be done in this great world of ours. This capacity
is usually indicated by a strong preference for that kind of work. The
capacity for doing is largely a matter of inheritance, and education is
simply the development of this capacity. No education which fails to
develop what is in the child is worth having; but no matter what may
be the natural endowment, the capacity to govern in State or Nation,
or to build a road, or to plow a straight furrow, or polish a pin, every
child must have put into his possession the tools by which he can
secure that education which will fit him for his life work. He must
know how to read, that he may be in touch with his fellow-man. He
must know how to write, that he may communicate his thoughts to
other men. He must know how to reason, that he may put this and
that together and draw conclusions. These lie at the foundation of all
education.</p>

<p>Some education is acquired in mastering the “Three R’s,” namely,
the power to observe—to see things—to tell what is seen and to draw
conclusions; but the “Three R’s” are, however, merely the tools by
which we ourselves afterwards acquire an education. In spite of all the
money we spend on rural education (in my State from 42 to 50 per cent.
of all rural taxes), our children neither read well nor write well nor
reason well. How can they when our rural schools average twelve
pupils, most of them less than ten, and often five, three, or only two or
one pupil, and are taught mainly by persons themselves but poorly educated,
and who are teaching simply to acquire the experience necessary
to secure a position in a city school. Neither the reading nor the writing
nor the arithmetic of these schools has any connection with the
farm nor any relation to farm life, nor is the teacher as a rule in sympathy
with that life. Yet this is all the education that 90 per cent.
of the farmborn will ever receive.</p>

<p>Little education this for the mighty task of feeding the world
at prices that those not on farms can afford to pay. If the farm boy
was so thoroughly drilled in reading that he could read to himself with
understanding and read to others with expression, if he could express
his thoughts so clearly and fully that the dullest could understand, if
he could see things as they are, and tell accurately what he sees, he
would in time without further teaching become a leader of men.</p>

<p>The farmborn, however, usually fares better than the townboy in
the race of life. In growing up in the open country he learns what
books can not teach—the know-how, so far as farm operations are concerned—and
needs but to learn the reason why. The townborn, as a
rule, has no opportunity to acquire the know-how by following the
occupation of their parents; and hence much of his school life is spent
in acquiring information which, apart from its educational value, is of
no sort of use to him in after life. What the farmborn need, if they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
to be efficient in life, is an opportunity to learn in a secondary school
in the open country the reason why. What the townborn need is secondary
education which will fit them for the work they are to do. If
our farmborn are to be efficient, they must have centralized schools
taught by teachers who have selected teaching as their life work and
are paid accordingly, and thus be able to acquire in the open country
a secondary education that will enable them to see clearly the reason
why they should plow, or sow or feed. If our townborn are to be efficient,
they must have in addition to a thorough mastery of the “Three
R’s,” which is the birthright of every child, such training as will
fit them for their life work.</p>

<p>The misery of our system, whether in town or country, is that it
assumes that the chief end of man is to figure in some one of the so-called
“learned” professions. So the high school is keyed up to the
standard of admission to the college and university. The grade school
exists to qualify pupils for admission to the high school. Hence the
surplus of doctors without patients, at a time when humanity is learning
how to avoid needing a doctor; of lawyers when men are fast learning
to keep out of law.</p>

<p>In short, the end and aim of all education in the future must needs
be efficiency in the line of the chosen vocation. The great lack of our
present system is the failure to give the child a complete and thorough
mastery of the tools by which any education worth while must be acquired:
the ability to read with understanding, to express itself, whether
in speech or writing, so that all may understand; the ability to see what
is to be seen and tell it in plain English, and to put this and that together
and draw a just conclusion.</p>

<p>I need not say that no training for efficiency is complete that does
not involve the ethical as well as the intellectual and material. This is a
Christian nation, and the ethics of Christianity should be taught in
every school as well as in every home. We may not, and should not
teach the dogmas or doctrines of any sect or denomination. We must
forever keep separate the Church and the State; but underlying all
these creeds and denominations there is an ethical standard which all
but the criminal or would-be criminal accept; and this should be taught,
because it embraces our highest ideals of manhood and womanhood and
citizenship.</p>

<p>The crimes of which we are rightly ashamed are due largely to the
fact that the jealousy of the churches toward each other has heretofore
prevented the teaching of ethics to the children in our schools. Without
the practice of ethics, without the striving to realize moral ideals,
there can be no moral efficiency, and without moral efficiency intellectual
efficiency may become productive of evil instead of good. An educated
brain without an educated conscience is a source of danger to the public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
welfare. It is high time for the churches and all good people to get
together and agree on ethical standards to be taught in every school,
that will put moral as well as intellectual training in the coming generation.</p>

<p>I have touched merely the high places of the subject of human efficiency.
I have endeavored to say that if the generation which is to follow
us and carry on our work is to be efficient, the children must be
well born and well fed, protected from the vampires that endeavor to
suck their lifeblood, and must have an opportunity to develop their
natural capacity by an education and training—physical, mental and
moral—that will enable them to do the world’s work with profit to themselves
and their fellow-man. (Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—In Denver, Colorado, some twelve years ago, there
was found a friend for children; there was found a judge who believed
that in the child brought before him for some breach of law, he could
see something divine, that he could see the soul, the germ of the future
man, the germ of a future life—something to redeem. He believed he
could see why Christ said, “Suffer the little children to come unto Me,
and forbid them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.” He had
faith in the child, and when he found it necessary, in the way of discipline,
to send them to the reform school, he placed faith in them; he
told them to go out to the reform school, and he would be up to see
how they were getting along after awhile. He developed character from
the start, and it soon became noised around. In every paper, in every
magazine, all over the world the name of Judge Ben B. Lindsey, of
Denver, Colorado, was known. (Applause.)</p>

<p>I now have the pleasure to introduce to you Judge Lindsey, who will
speak on the subject “Is the Child Worth Conserving?” (Prolonged
applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Is the Child Worth Conserving”</span></h3>
<p>Judge <span class="smcap">Lindsey</span>—Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am sure
I appreciate this very cordial and kind reception, because it shows
your appreciation, not of the speaker, but of a cause—in which I have
only had a small part—that has come close to the heart of the people of
this Nation in the last decade or more, and well it is that the great
National Conservation Congress should not overlook the welfare of the
child.</p>

<p>I was delighted to note in the splendid address which we have just
listened to by Dr. Wallace, that this important matter of the child, the
youth, furnished its principal theme, because without childhood there
is no manhood; without the conservation of childhood there is nothing
else to conserve.</p>

<p>But my friends, I am in rather a difficult position tonight. I am
reminded, indeed, of an experience I had with a boy about twelve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
years ago in my court. It was before the days of the Detention Home
School. One day I was down in the jail, and they told me they had a
boy there that they thought belonged to me—that they could do nothing
with him. So I went with one of the men down the long corridor to a
cage, that would have been a disgrace to the king of the jungle, and
there in a heap on the floor was a boy. I recognized him as a boy who
had been missing from the truancy department for about a month. It
seems that he had read in a paper that some man in New York had lost
his boy—about the age of this boy—so he framed up a story and went
to the police and told them he was the missing boy. There was a reward
offered for the lost boy, and there was an argument between the lieutenant
and one of the sergeants as to who saw him first—and in trying
to straighten this out they discovered the fraud. I said to him, “Harry,
what did you mean by this?” He replied, “Judge, dey spoiled the
dandiest bum I ever thought of.”</p>

<p>I asked him where he had been for the last month, and he said he
had been living in a piano box. I went with him, and he showed me the
piano box, and as we came up a dog, a faithful, friendly dog, jumped
out and recognized the boy. While we stood there I heard some boys
just around the corner of the alley, talking about someone. Some of
them insisted that “he only gets full once a month,” while some one
said “he gets full once a week.” For a moment, I forgot the law of the
“gang” in regard to “snitchin’,” and I said, “Harry, who are those
boys talking about?” There had been a boy before me for intoxication,
and I wanted to find out if this was the same one. So I said, “You slip
around there and find out who it is they are talking about, and you’ll
save a lot of trouble for me—and for somebody else.”</p>

<p>The boy hesitated a little, torn between loyalty to the judge and
loyalty to the “gang,” but finally he went. In a little while he came
back, and looking into my face without the least change of expression,
said: “Judge, dem fellas is talkin’ about the moon; some says it gets
full once a week, and some only once a month.” Then, after a minute,
he continued, “Judge, you don’t always find out everything you want
to.”</p>

<p>Some time ago, I was informed by my friend, Mr. Shipp, that I
was to read a report at this Congress, but I found when I arrived that
they had me down for an entirely different subject. However, both my
report and the subject assigned me concern that very important subject,
“the child.” Many things have transpired during the last year to give
us hope and courage in the work for the child, and after all there is
one thing that marks this century of ours, makes it distinct from all
other centuries, and that is the fact that it is the century of the child.
Indeed, it seems we are to realize the promise of holy writ, that a little
child shall lead us. We are beginning to see, through the misfortunes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
the child, through their tears and sufferings, many of the causes that
are not only responsible for the troubles of children but for the troubles
of men. For, after all, there is no child problem that isn’t a parent
problem—a problem of the home. And when we get back to the problem
of the home we are, of course, face to face with all the great social,
economic, industrial and political problems. Even the political parties
are at least beginning to understand that if they would meet with the
approval of the people they must concern themselves more about the
problems of humanity; that they must present real remedies which
promise an immediate check for the terrible waste of life, of energy
and of power, which is going on in this nation. That while it is important
to conserve our material resources—the power of our waterfalls
and the verdure of our forests—we must also conserve our human
resources. After all, these great assets of the nation are very closely
linked together. The strength and future well-being of the race itself
must depend in a large measure upon the Conservation with which this
organization has so well concerned itself during the past decade. It is
only a natural and to be expected step in the evolution of its work
that it should equally concern itself more directly with the human beings
who will not be able to profit from its work unless their welfare is
also conserved in other directions.</p>

<p>It has long been the opinion of specialists and social workers in
this country that the national government itself was not doing all
that it should do for the welfare of the children of the nation. Largely
because of the failure of any government agency directly responsible for
such work, the various methods of dealing with the many-sided problems
of childhood were more or less in a state of chaos. The matter
was first brought to the attention of Congress through a bill formulated
and agreed to by the various child saving agencies of the State of Colorado,
and introduced in Congress by Hon. John F. Shafroth, the present
Governor of Colorado, in 1902, providing for a government bureau that
should directly concern itself with the welfare of children. This effort
was followed several years later by other child saving agencies in the
introduction of what is now popularly known as “A bill for the establishment
of a children’s bureau.” This bill was free from some of
the objections of the earlier bill which included governmental protection
for dumb animals, as well as a special bureau for the welfare of
children. Great impetus was given to this final effort by former President
Roosevelt, who called the White House conference on dependent
children that met in Washington City on January 25 and 26, 1909, when
a resolution was adopted recommending the enactment of the then
pending measure.</p>

<p>The National Consumers’ League in its Tenth Annual Report presented,
perhaps, the ablest summary of all those presented concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
the necessity for such a bureau. This summary pointed out many items
of information that ought to be valuable concerning the children of the
Nation—information that, as amazing as it may seem, was practically
impossible to be had in this Nation of ours concerning its children:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>1. How many blind children are there in the United States? Where are
they? What provision for their education is made? How many of them are
receiving training for self-support? What are the causes of their blindness?
What steps are taken to prevent blindness?</p>

<p>2. How many mentally subnormal children are there in the United States,
including idiots, imbeciles, and children sufficiently self-directing to profit by
special classes in school? Where are these children? What provision is made for
their education? What does it cost? How many of them are receiving training
for self-support?</p>

<p>3. How many fatherless children are there in the United States? Of these,
how many fathers are dead? How many are illegitimate? How many are deserters?
In cases in which the father is dead, what killed him? It should be
known how much orphanage is due to tuberculosis, how much to industrial accidents,
etc. Such knowledge is needful for the removal of preventable causes of
orphanage.</p>

<p>4. We know something about juvenile illiteracy once in 10 years. The subject
should be followed up every year. It is not a matter of immigrant children,
but of a permanent, sodden failure of the Republic to educate a half million
children of native English-speaking citizens. Current details are now unattainable.</p>

<p>5. Experience in Chicago under the only effective law on this subject in
this country indicates that grave crimes against children are far more common
than is generally known. There is no official source of wider information upon
which other States may base improved legislation or administration.</p>

<p>6. How many children are employed in manufacture? In commerce? In
the telegraph and messenger service? How many children are working underground
in mines? How many at the mine’s mouth? Where are these children?
What are the mine labor laws applicable to children? We need a complete annual
directory of State officials whose duty it is to enforce child-labor laws.
This for the purpose of stimulating to imitation those States which have no
such officials, as well as for arousing public interest in the work of the existing
officials.</p>

<p>7. We need current information as to juvenile courts, and they need to be
standardized. For instance, no juvenile court keeps a record of the various occupations
pursued by the child before its appearance in court beyond, in some cases,
the actual occupation at the time of the offense committed. Certain occupations
are known to be demoralizing to children, but the statistics which would prove
this are not now kept. It is reasonable to hope that persistent, recurrent inquiries
from the Federal children’s bureau may induce local authorities to keep their
records in such form as to make them valuable both to the children concerned
and to children in parts of the country which have no similar institutions.</p>

<p>8. There is no accepted standard of truancy work. In some places truant
officers report daily, in others weekly, in some monthly, in others never. Some
truant officers do no work whatever in return for their salaries. There should
be some standard of efficiency for work of this sort, but first we need to know
the facts.</p>

<p>9. Finally, and by far the most important, we do not know how many
children are born each year, or how many die, or why they die. We need statistics
of nativity and mortality.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>The American Federation of Labor, the labor unions, and, of course,
practically all of the social workers of the Nation have united through
every means in their power to create the sentiment that has finally
resulted in a Federal children’s bureau.</p>

<p>This, then, is the most significant and, at the same time, the most
hopeful single item of accomplishment for the conservation of the
childhood welfare of the Nation for the past year. Next in importance
to the establishment of the bureau itself is the appointment by the President
in the person of Miss Julia T. Lathrop as its chief. Her long and
devoted service with Miss Jane Addams at Hull House in Chicago, her
well-known interest and experience in the sociological work that has
occupied so many years of her useful life have especially equipped her
for this work. While, up to the time of the establishment of the children’s
bureau, we were rather lagging behind the European nations,
the various national and international conferences held throughout Europe
during the past year have been greatly stimulated by the example
our Government has set in establishing this special work for the Conservation
of the Nation’s best asset. It is hard, therefore, to estimate
the far-reaching influence of this wise and generous step on the part
of the National Government. It was my privilege, with others, to
attend sessions of the congressional committees and speak in behalf of
the National Children’s Bureau, and my enthusiasm is just as great as
it ever was for that important step, but I am not one of those who have
believed that when we establish the bureau we have done all that we can
do as a Nation to conserve the welfare of the children. No doubt the
bureau will accomplish much through such an educational campaign as
it may be able to conduct, and the gathering together of very important
information upon subjects that at present are left largely to conjecture,
and concerning which we shall still be left very much in the dark. But
I wish to predict that its chief service in the end will be, as I hope it will
be, to point out some of the needed changes in social, economic and industrial
fabric that must be made if we are going to truly conserve the
interests of the child. A program of social justice, definitely proposed
and persistently carried out will in the end do much more for the welfare
of the children of the Nation than all the bureaus that we can establish.</p>

<p>The agitation carried on principally by social workers, juvenile courts
and probation officers, for the past ten years in behalf of what is popularly
known as “Mothers’ Pensions,” has begun to bear fruit. As far
back as 1899, a few of the States recognized the principle that it should
share with certain homes the responsibility for the education of the
child by not only providing free schools but also by providing aid for
certain needy parents of children in order that the children could have
the educational advantages afforded by the State. The demand for an
extension of this recognition of the principle has met with response<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
during the past two years in the State of Missouri and the State of
Illinois. While the Missouri law was the first definite mothers’ pension
law, so-called, to become effective, it differs from the Illinois law in
that it is limited to certain large cities. A somewhat similar law in
Illinois has now been in force for a little more than a year. It is much
broader in scope. Generally speaking, these laws vest power in the
juvenile courts, after proper hearing, to direct the authorities dispensing
public revenues, to pay to the parents—generally the mother—of
dependent children a sum sufficient for the mother to care for the
children in her own home, where the conditions are such, of course, as
to justify keeping the child in its own home. It is assumed that the
judge will act with wisdom and discretion and not abuse the power
vested in him for the protection of dependent children. As a rule, this
confidence in the court is not misplaced. But I am strongly opposed to
legislation of this kind that is not carefully hedged about with such
safeguards as to avoid possible abuses under it. For it is the abuses
of such laws that furnish ammunition to its foes. This is not an
objection to the principle of the law or a criticism of those who are entitled
to so much credit for its passage. Most any kind of a law to start
with establishing the principle should be more than welcome. The safeguards
needed must largely develop in the course of practice and experience
under it, when they may be added by suitable amendments from
time to time—not an uncommon history of most all legislation of this
character.</p>

<p>In many States, as in Colorado, where we have on several occasions
attempted to secure legislation of this kind, we have met with failure for
several reasons. The need has not seemed to legislators to be as acute
as in States with more congested populations, in large cities like New
York and Chicago. And in many States the laws already on the statute
books have been fairly sufficient for their needs. Not only in Colorado,
but many other States, to my personal knowledge, in exceptional or
proper cases, mothers have been pensioned by the county commissioners,
or assisted under school laws to such an extent that the lack of a more
definite law upon the subject has not been seriously felt. But any
State, in which there is a city of over 100,000 population or a considerable
number of small cities of over 25,000 population, if it would truly
conserve the welfare of its children, should not hesitate to adopt definite
and effective legislation of this character.</p>

<p>But signs of opposition to such legislation are by no means lacking.
It has been denounced in some quarters as paternalistic—socialistic,
and entirely beyond the province or within the power of the State. But
the time has long since passed in this country when there should be any
serious question of not only the power but the duty of the State when it
comes to the protection of its children. I say “its children” because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
the State is the supreme parent—the over-parent. From one viewpoint
the State is superior to the natural parent. It says to the parent,
“If you neglect your child you forfeit your right to its custody.” This
is a just power to be wisely exercised. It is primarily for the welfare
of the child. Because of the natural ties of love and affection that are
supposed to exist between parent and child it is assumed by the State
that the best place for the child is in its own home with its own father
and mother. This is a wise balance for this rather exceptional power of
the State. The State wisely recognizes that the home is the foundation
of society, and since it is in the interest of the State to keep the child
in the home, as one of the very best methods of preserving the home,
the first duty of the agents of the State should be to bring about that
result in every case possible. In fighting for the child the State is only
fighting for its own preservation.</p>

<p>Another prime duty of the State is to compel the father to support
the child and also to support the wife, not so much because it is the wife
but because it is a woman who is the mother of a child, or may be the
mother of a child. One great weakness in the nonsupport laws of the
various States and, at the same time, a danger in the mothers’ pension
acts of the various States is the lack of a practical system of operation
and enforcement that will not permit the father to shirk—that will
hold him to a strict accountability to his duty to the State, namely,
to support the child. The child is the State and the State is the child.
The man or woman, therefore, who does most for the child does most
for the State. As a part of every nonsupport law and mothers’ compensation
act should be provisions for workhouses where fathers who wilfully
and without excuse refuse to perform their duty to the child should be
committed.</p>

<p>Failing in the last Legislature in Colorado to get any legislation for
the relief of needy mothers, our people have appealed to the people
under their rights to initiative laws, for what we term a Mothers’ Compensation
Law, rather than a Mothers’ Pension Act. We think that the
difference is more than a mere haggling over terms.</p>

<p>The State maintains a standing army for its protection. Soldiers
fighting its battles, or standing ready to fight its battles while performing
that function, are paid—compensated. They receive money, food and
clothing from the State. When the fight is over, when they have retired
from service, in their old age they are pensioned.</p>

<p>In a different capacity, but none the less important and effective, do
mothers of children serve the State. They do not face death on the
field of battle, but they go down to the gates of death and bring back
their children. The perils and hardships that soldiers endure in times
of war are more than equalled by the struggles of hundreds of thousands
of mothers fighting the enemies of the State that killing competition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
and the injustices of present economic conditions have raised up
in its path. In fighting these enemies to save their children to the
State these women are more serviceable soldiers of the State even than
those sons they reared, who may have died on the field of battle.</p>

<p>The term “pension,” therefore, is a misnomer. It is confusing. It
interferes with a real understanding of what this fight is all about.</p>

<p>It might not be a bad idea to consider pensioning mothers, as we
pension soldiers after the battle is fought, after they have gone through
the valley of the shadow, after they have slaved, and toiled and suffered
and reared their children to manhood and womanhood, to guarantee
them a peaceful, happy old age by providing a “pension.” But while
they are engaged in the service of the State, in saving the State by
saving the child, I insist, where it is necessary to enable them to do
their part in the battle, they should be paid—they should be compensated.</p>

<p>I insist further that the compensation should no more be in the
interest of the mother than it should be in the interest of the soldier,
except as a means of preserving the home and the State, except as in
the interest of public morals and for the prevention of poverty and
crime—all of which is necessary to save the State.</p>

<p>Maternity is more than a prompting of nature. It is a patriotic duty
to the State. As in the case of the patriot who enlists for the war, of
course it should be voluntary and in accord with social and religious
custom. But a wilful evasion of so plain a duty should be visited with
the same contempt that meets the deserter from the ranks. As the profession
of the soldier is no more the business of the individual without
the part and duty of the State, neither is the perpetuation of the race
wholly the business of the individual. And of course it is the duty of the
State to see that those individuals responsible for the race should perform
their duty. There must be laws recognizing the man as the breadwinner
and the mother as the home maker. The man must be held
strictly accountable to the State for the support of the woman he has
chosen to be the mother of his children. And this must be primarily
not so much in the interest of the woman as in the interest of the children
she bears or is expected to bear. If the man fails in his duty he
should be compelled to perform that duty where it is possible to compel
him to do it. If that is not possible, then the State itself must assume
the burden. If the man has wilfully shirked it must provide workhouses
in which he can be made to perform the duty he has voluntarily
undertaken.</p>

<p>But, at whatever expense or hazard, the State must see that the
child is protected. This is impossible unless the mother is protected.</p>

<p>The State has no right to scold women for race suicide when the
State itself is responsible for race suicide. The father would have just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
as much right to scold his child for stealing when the neglect of the
father was responsible for the thefts of the child. The State has just
as important a part in this problem as the individual. The individual
must do his duty, but the State must see that the conditions are such
that it is possible for the individual to perform his part. If the struggle
for bread makes maternity a tragedy instead of a blessing, it is the
duty of the State to reverse the conditions and make maternity a blessing
instead of a tragedy. (Applause.)</p>

<p>In conclusion, I want to utter a warning. In standing for the policy
of the State to guarantee compensation to the mothers of children, the
State becomes responsible in a measure for every child coming into the
world. The next logical step will be for the State to demand a right to
say who shall and who shall not be the fathers and mothers of its children.
It follows that the Mothers’ Compensation Act is only a part of
a new code now in process of development in which the State shall become
more and more responsible, not only for the children who are
born into the world, but for the kind of children that are born into the
world and the parentage of those children. It is all a part of a wise
system of laws the purpose of which shall be as far as proper and
possible to exclude the unfit from the rights of parenthood.</p>

<p>The revival of that interesting cult of eugenics now attracting so
much attention, the demand for the teaching of sex hygiene and the
agitation of kindred subjects now going on throughout the whole civilized
world, is simply a response to the growing need and the growing
demand that the State should become the over-parent of the race.</p>

<p>It is impossible in the time allowed for this discussion and the subjects
that such a report should occupy to do more than discuss one or two
of the recent activities in behalf of the Conservation of the child life
of the Nation. Much excellent work has been done by other organizations,
some of which, because of the limitations mentioned, it may be
impossible to refer to. But I must especially commend the work of
the Men and Religion Forward Movement and the excellent report of its
Boys’ Work Commission. After all, the work for the boy is necessarily
in a large measure also a work for the girl. This report ably discusses
the religious needs of the child; the message of Christianity to
childhood; the essential principles of organized work with children in
the church, the Sunday-school and local organizations, and the relation
of these organizations to the home and the child and to social and sex
hygiene.</p>

<p>Of similar importance is the laborious, able and excellent report on
the safeguarding of adolescent youth, prepared for the International
Sunday-school Association under the direction of Mr. Wilbur R. Crafts
and his committee of assistants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Wallace spoke of the need of moral education, and I heartily
agree with him; but what are you going to do in the case of a bright
boy who knows more about politics than he does about Sunday-school?
I have a boy like this in my mind. He knew the ward boss, knew all
about him—his authority over the dives and all that. But I thought he
needed moral training, so he was induced to go to Sunday-school. I
saw him afterwards and asked him what he learned in Sunday-school.
“Aw,” he said, “it’s a place where all the little kids go and gives up a
penny, but they don’t git nothin’ back.” “But you learned something,
didn’t you?” I asked. “Yes,” he said, “they learned me about the
angels; they learned me they had wings like chickens, but they didn’t
learn me whether they laid eggs or not.”</p>

<p>I agree with Dr. Wallace that we need to change our methods. Of
course Dr. Wallace has had a different experience from mine. He has
children. I have children—a thousand of them—but they belong to
other folk.</p>

<p>There is no more important subject than the safeguarding of childhood
and youth against the moral perils of the modern community.
Under this head the important matter of regulating dance halls, skating
rinks, moving picture shows and various places of amusement is becoming
more and more one of the serious problems of community life.</p>

<p>The able reports of one or two vice commissions of the large cities,
notably Chicago and Minneapolis, have added much to the literature
and information valuable to those who are interested in conserving and
protecting the moral welfare of the nation’s youth.</p>

<p>Let me say here that I was in a city where they had such a vice
commission, and one of the officials told me the number of women who
had been forced into prostitution, or had been forced half-way there. I
asked him the ages of these women, and he said practically they were all
between eighteen and thirty-five, and on looking up the statistics we
found that this number of women thus forced into this unholy life was
10 per cent. of all the women between eighteen and thirty-five in that
city. It is a frightful thing, my friends, but if these things exist, if
they are facts, we are false to our children and false to our country if we
try to blind our eyes to these facts. It is our duty, and as Dr. Wallace
has said, there is no place in this country where these things ought to be
more freely discussed than in a Congress like this.</p>

<p>The child welfare exhibit, beginning with that of Chicago and duplicated
in a measure in other large cities, is one of the most notable contributions
in recent times in the great work of conserving the welfare
of childhood.</p>

<p>The wider use of the schools in its more careful regard for the physical
welfare of children must also be added to the hopeful signs of the
times. The terrific waste in money, energy and effort that is going on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
in the cities because of the many boards controlling such activities as
schools, playgrounds, social centers, public libraries, art galleries and
public baths promises to be largely avoided by a consolidation of these
activities under the control of one board with the schools as a great
social center, to which is added its neighborhood dance hall, public
baths, public library, public assembly hall, public playground and social
center under one single authority, such as a board of education and
recreation that promises to avoid the bickerings, difficulties, expense and
waste that is the outcome from duplicated boards. Activities that are
largely educational and concern the city’s youth, now largely under a
half-dozen boards or authorities, should be brought together under one
general authority. An amendment to the Constitution of the State
of Colorado proposing such a consolidation and the use of the schoolhouses
as polling places and for the discussion of governmental, social
and political questions during campaigns, is to be voted on at the November
election.</p>

<p>And now, my friends, in conclusion I want to say that one of the
prime duties of the Nation—its duty to the child—is to extend to the
women the same rights as the men, that they may go to the polls and
vote on these measures. (Applause.) This is not politics, Mr. President,
it is a plain, economic proposition, because I believe the women
of this country are awake to the needs of the children, especially those
in the centers of population, and when they are given this right they
will pass laws that are necessary to bring about right and justice for the
women and children of this Nation. (Applause.) I would not have my
position today but for the fact that women vote in Colorado. (Laughter.)
Either the bosses, the machine or the gang would have got me
long ago. Why? Because I went beyond the court into the swamp
lands, not beyond the city, but within the city, and showed up the
ghosts of poverty and crime and the relations between a certain type
of lawless big boss and vice. And when the mother could see that the
protection of her boy and her girl from vice depended upon clean politics
and righteous laws, then, my friends, the change began to come,
and it is coming in our State as in every other State in this Nation—then
began a reign of truth and right and progress. (Applause.) And
when the women of our city understood what machine rule meant, they
rose in their might, with the ballot in their hands, and put an end to
machine rule in that city.</p>

<p>I remember a little boy that belonged to one of our debating clubs
on the west side, who was very much disturbed over the making of some
new laws. He came to see me, and when I asked him what he wanted,
he pulled a piece of paper out of his pocket, on which was written:
“Resolved, That all kids over ten years of age shall have a right to vote
for the juvenile judge.” “And then,” said little Benny, “when we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
gets that law through the bosses will never get you, and we kids will get
justice.”</p>

<p>But it was not necessary.</p>

<p>I remember we had a little fellow who was quite a fluent speaker, and
finally one of the bosses began to get alarmed at the effect this boy’s talk
was having. The boss said to him, “You have a lot of mouth, but you
have no vote.” Quick as a flash came the answer, “I haven’t got a vote,
but I would have you understand that in the State of Colorado my
mother has a vote, and my sister has a vote, and she married a fellow
and he has a vote, and they will see that he votes right.”</p>

<p>And the boy’s prediction was more than verified, for when the votes
were counted the majority was on the right side, and the people who
were working to relieve poverty and the suffering of children had won
by ten thousand majority.</p>

<p>So I feel we must have the women with us in this struggle for the
rights of childhood in this Nation, and with that right guaranteed they
will bring about sooner than any other agency some changes for good in
this Nation. If we are to save the child we want to save the State,
for the child is the State and the State is the child. Take care of the
child and the State will take care of itself. (Great applause.)</p>

o’clock a. m.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—We are a little late in gathering this morning.
The meetings last night were rather strenuous. There were meetings
in two different places, and the one I attended had seventeen or eighteen
hundred in the audience, so we know we have a large attendance. The
idea of having sectional meetings is a good one, because it enables discussions
at greater length upon special subjects that concern different
people interested. Day before yesterday, we had three meetings going
on at the same time. Then we have an illustration of what is needed in
the way of civic reform and good government over at the State House,
and none of us should miss this. It is going on all the time. It appeals
to the eye, and we can see at a glance so much that is needed in this battle
for reform.</p>

Tenn., and one from Anna Caroline Benning of Columbus, Ga. These
telegrams contain greetings, and also suggestions as to the next meeting
place of the Congress. We are glad to have suggestions as to the next
meeting place, but under the Constitution the Executive Committee
takes up this matter for consideration, and they have three or four
months to do it in.</p>

<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—We also have a report from Col. M. H. Crump

<p class="center">REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL PARK TO
INCLUDE MAMMOTH CAVE.</p>

<p>Immediately on notification of appointment by President J. B. White,
the committee (Dr. Henry S. Drinker, Hon. William P. Borland, Mr.
Gifford Pinchot and Col. M. H. Crump, with Dr. W. J. McGee as Chairman)
organized by correspondence and proceeded to work through both
individual and collective action. Largely at the instance of Col. Crump,
Hon. Robert Y. Thomas, Jr., a Representative from Kentucky, introduced
a bill (H. R. 1666) providing for the establishment of a National
Park to include Mammoth Cave, and this was duly referred to the
House Committee on Military Affairs. Before this body your committee
appeared at formal hearings on February 1, February 5 and May 3.
Early in February a similar bill was introduced in the Senate by Hon.
William O. Bradley and referred to the Senate Committee on Public
Lands; before this body also your committee (through Col. Crump and
the Chairman) appeared at a formal hearing on February 6. Both before
and after these hearings members of the committee personally presented
the matter before members of both branches of the Federal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
Congress; Dr. Drinker by correspondence, since he was out of the country
until too late to attend the early hearings.</p>

<p>Your committee have to report, with regret, that while the requisite
early steps looking toward the desired legislation were taken, the bills
have not yet been reported from the Congressional Committees and
probably will not be during the present session. Accordingly, we recommend
that this be considered a report of progress; that the National
Conservation Congress be requested through its Resolutions Committee
to once more urge on the Federal Congress the eminent desirability of
creating a National Park to include the Mammoth Cave, and that an
appropriate committee be created through the National Conservation
Congress of 1912 to continue action in the premises.</p>

<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—This report will be turned over to the new
President.</p>

<p>It is now my pleasure to introduce to this audience a gentleman
from the Pacific Coast who has long been an active worker in the cause
of Conservation, especially in the conservation of forests. He is well
known to all on the Pacific Coast and to every man in the Central and
Eastern States. He is President of the National Lumber Manufacturers’
Association, and he will treat the subject of Conservation from “The
Lumberman’s Viewpoint.” Major E. G. Griggs, of Tacoma, Washington.
(Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Lumberman’s Viewpoint”</span></h3>
<p>Major <span class="smcap">Griggs</span>—Gentlemen, Members of the Convention: I want to
voice the sentiment of the lumbermen of the country particularly in
approving the action taken by this Congress in allowing us to have our
own conferences in reference to the interests in which we are vitally
concerned, together with the general meeting. I think that has been
one of the best features of this Congress.</p>

<p>The objects of the National Conservation Congress are so clearly exploited
in the Second Article of our Constitution that I believe a repetition
of them is clearly in order that we may keep them uppermost in
our minds:</p>

<p>“(1) To provide a forum for discussion of the resources of the
United States as the foundation for the prosperity of the people, (2) to
furnish definite information concerning the resources and their utilization,
and (3) to afford an agency through which the people of the country
may frame policies and principles affecting the wise and practical
development, conservation and utilization of the resources to be put into
effect by their representatives in State and Federal government.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>I have attended all of these Congresses and have been wonderfully
impressed with the zeal and interest manifested in these proceedings.
The vital questions considered are touching the popular chord and its
effect is vibrating the length and breadth of the land.</p>

<p>Some are drawn here by one interest and some by another, but all
recognize the wisdom and need of arousing our people to a consideration
of the resources of our country and their proper utilization. In the
cauldron of our national development, mix a little philanthropy, patriotism
and politics and you can stir up the most phlegmatic of our citizens.</p>

<p>To my mind, the great results we wish to secure in this Conservation
effort can only be realized by directing the attention of the millions who
do not attend these annual meetings to the importance in our State and
national life of the subject-matter we have under consideration.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the American people wish to see general prosperity
and proper utilization of the resources of the country, regardless
of the political ambitions of any individual or party. Conservation will
only be realized when it takes such a strong hold of the people that any
man or set of men will sink to political oblivion if they do not promote
its cause.</p>

<p>Three years ago we were somewhat startled by the announcement, I
think from the originators of this movement, that the electric companies
had combined to control the water powers of the country. Today I come
from a State where a stupendous amalgamation of capital has recently
combined the hydro-electric plants of the Puget Sound basin. Not that
this is detrimental to our development, but that the acquiring of these
perpetual rights and control of natural resources should be well
considered by the people and subject forever to their supervision.</p>

<p>The cupidity of capital will only be curbed by the assurance to the
long-time investor that the Government is behind the investment and the
people will not forever back the investment unless they are in on the deal.</p>

<p>Our country is comparatively new and we need to encourage capital
and labor in every way to develop the latent resources, but we want to
make better trades than we have made in the past if we wish to hold
the respect of either.</p>

<p>The old saying that “Uncle Sam is rich enough to give us all a farm”
sounded siren-like to all, and was necessary to encourage the settler,
but there is a limit to even Uncle Sam’s patrimony—and irrigation costs
money. No doubt the State of Washington, which I represent, has profited
as much as any other by the liberal policy of the Government, but
there forest reserves have been declared and in lieu of worthless timber
tracts scrip has been issued to bona fide settlers or original grantees, and
for this same scrip some of the choice timber lands of the country have
been exchanged. I conclude that “David Harum” is discounted in a
trade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>The lumber manufacturers of the country have in recent years been
in the limelight of trust investigators, and to what purpose? If to foster
the political ambitions of some demagogue, I am sure it will fail. There
may be organizations back of labor and capital which come under the
ban of the law, but when such general conclusions are drawn, as in the
Missouri Ouster Case, that the National Lumber Manufacturers’ Association
is an unlawful combination in restraint of trade, as President of
that association I “deny the allegation and defy the allegator.”</p>

<p>There is too much of loose talk in censuring the efforts of associations
generally. The very theories you as Conservationists are advancing are
uppermost in the minds of association workers. And the greatest development
in forest Conservation and fire protection has its origin and support
from these associations. We have something to conserve and are not
mere theorists. With rising values of timber and utilization of lower
grades of lumber, the product of the entire tree will be saved.</p>

<p>This is where the shoe pinches. It is going to cost more money to
conserve. The low grades of lumber, slabs, and waste from a mill must
bring enough money when sold to pay for the labor expended in saving
them. Then, and then only, will they be saved.</p>

<p>Trees can only be reproduced on soil suitable for that purpose and
for no other. The timber crop is the process of years of growth, and
annual taxes, perpetual fire risk and the desire to use the land for more
frequent crops are the deterrent features of reforestation. We only
need to look abroad, where common lumber brings the price of mahogany
in this country, to realize that an article to be saved and reproduced must
have commercial value.</p>

<p>Your great centers of population in the East and Middle West are
today beginning to realize that happiness, health and long life of the
people will be your greatest commercial asset. The country is becoming
aroused to the needs of forest, lake, stream and fresh air to build up
American citizenship. We in the West, like the pioneers who have
worked their way across the American continent, do not appreciate our
own resources until we realize the vast sums being appropriated in your
dense centers of population to reinstate in a measure the surroundings
in which we revel.</p>

<p>Population, transportation and ability to pay are all determining
factors in our national development. It takes something more than
philanthropy to meet a payroll or pay the grocer, and too little heed is
given the trials and privations of our pioneer life in some of our theories.</p>

<p>We lumbermen of the West Coast, where transportation charge alone
equals more than the original cost of our lumber to you, are sometimes
rebuffed in our efforts to conserve, where of necessity the waste is large.</p>

<p>We are not slow in the West and South in developing the use of
wooden block paving, in establishing creosote plants to prolong the life of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
our product, but in our recent attempts to get the consumer to use odd
and short lengths to prevent a waste in our mills of 2 per cent. of our
planing mill product, we are balked in our efforts and forced to the
burners with a lot of trimmings.</p>

<p>I have just read the following from an address delivered by Joseph
B. Knapp, assistant district forester in the United States Service, which
bears out my contention:</p>

<p>“Coast lumbermen a few years ago unitedly endeavored to introduce
the use of flooring, ceiling, finish and other planing mill products in
multiples of one foot from three feet upward. At this time the United
States Forest Service made an investigation of the waste due to manufacturing
planing mill products in multiples of two feet. We found this
waste to be over two per cent. of the material run through planing mills
in Oregon and Washington, or the equivalent of the yearly growth of wood
on approximately 30,000 acres of good timberland. The consuming trade
refused to accept odd lengths and after a conscientious attempt on the
part of lumber manufacturers, it was found necessary to discontinue the
manufacture of odd lengths over ten feet. It is therefore seen that the
useless waste in the manufacture of lumber can not always be attributed
to the lack of a desire on the part of the lumber manufacturer to introduce
economical practices. It remains for the ultimate consumer of our
timber products to determine in what form these products shall be supplied
to him, and therefore conservative lumbering and close manufacture
are dependent as much upon the layman as upon the manufacturer.”</p>

<p>Our British Columbia neighbors are keenly alive to their timber
interests and their forest service is alive to the situation. Mr. Benedict,
assistant forester of British Columbia, in a recent address stated that
in British Columbia, on a very conservative estimate, after eliminating
waste land, rocky mountain slopes and peaks, they had 65,000,000 acres
capable of producing merchantable timber and valueless for any other
purpose.</p>

<p>“The productiveness of this land in timber will vary from 1,000 hard
feet per acre per year in particularly favorable localities on the coast to
25 or 50 board feet per acre per year on the mountains of the interior,”
he says, “but I am confident that the average yield will amount to 100
board feet at least. This gives an annual production of 6,500,000,000
feet.</p>

<p>“Allowing for a temporary overproduction of lumber brought on by
the desire of the holders of timber limits to realize on their investment
as quickly as possible, it will be seen that the stand of mature timber will
last from fifty to seventy-five years. At the end of seventy-five years,
when this mature timber is cut, the present stand of second growth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
timber will have matured so that the annual production can be maintained
perpetually at 6,500,000,000 feet. All this provided the present
stand of mature timber is preserved from destruction by fire and likewise
that the second growth is able to escape fire and grow to maturity.</p>

<p>“The stake then for which the forest protection force is working is
an annual crop of 6,500,000,000 feet of timber, worth to the Government,
say, $6,000,000, and to the community $100,000,000. To win the stake
fire must be kept out of the area of 100,000,000 acres, or a block of forest
400 miles square. The problem, both on account of the immense area,
the variety of causes of fire, the absence of means of transportation and
communication, and the present sparseness of population, is a most difficult
one to solve. The safe harvesting of the annual yield will require,
besides the expenditure of large sums of money, the good will of every
citizen in the Province. However, everything favors the satisfactory
working out of the problem.”</p>

<p>I quote the above to prove that we are not alone in our efforts to
conserve and provide for the future of our country.</p>

<p>Our associated efforts are being extended continually along the lines
of economy in manufacture, in the matter of standard grades and sizes,
inspection and insurance. Where is the commodity that can be intelligently
transported and marketed without a thorough knowledge of both
production and consumption? I now claim, and always have claimed,
that associated efforts to disseminate this information and collectively
endorse projects financially and otherwise to promote the study of forestry
and lumbering are the highest types of Conservation of the Nation’s
resources.</p>

<p>In the great State of Washington, which is now furnishing more
lumber than any other State in the Union, and where the lumber production
is the chief industry of the State, we are vitally concerned in our
legislative work, and concerning our Workman’s Compensation Act I
wish to bring to this particular Congress a special message. I believe
this act emphasizes the benefits of co-operative effort in conserving human
life and in protecting the breadwinner, upon whom depends the life and
happiness of so large a population.</p>

<p>With an industry affecting throughout the United States over 45,000
sawmills and 800,000 employes, regardless of families dependent on
them, you will agree with me that we are all vitally interested in workmen’s
compensation.</p>

<p>In a recent Bulletin of the National Lumber Manufacturers’ Association,
Mr. Bronson wrote as follows:</p>

<p>“Thirteen States have adopted workmen’s compensation acts, and all
have become effective since September 1, 1910. All but one of these
laws are optional, the exception being the Washington law, which is compulsory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
and which, according to the brief experience had, seems to be
the most satisfactory both to employers and employes, saving the employer
all expense for industrial insurance, and saving both employer
and employe all court costs and giving to the employe the full compensation
provided by the law without any deduction for lawyers or fees.</p>

<p>“The thirteen States which have adopted compensation acts are California,
Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Rhode Island, Washington and Wisconsin.
In all of these States the common-law defenses are in whole or
part wiped out where the employer does not come under the compensation
act.”</p>

<p>The law in the State of Washington has now been in operation one
year. To those of us who have operated under it, it has already proved
what its advocates claimed the most advanced piece of legislation enacted—and
we have woman’s suffrage, too.</p>

<p>It is surprising what an effect it has had in clearing the court docket
of damage suits and in paying to the injured at a time when the money
is needed all the award without the intervention of a third party. With
a carefully selected commission of three, responsible to the Governor,
and non-partisan in character, we have launched a statute that, regardless
of any improvements which may be determined or defects disclosed,
has improved the industrial atmosphere both for employe and employer.</p>

<p>The State appropriates a fund of $150,000 to administer the act for
two years. The risks are classified and rates assessed, and quarterly
payments called for as required.</p>

<p>The statistical records being made and knowledge gained by the Commission
in administering this act will be invaluable and it has already
brought to the attention of loggers, lumbermen and all manufacturers
the loss of life and limb incidental to the business, the benefits of factory
inspection as a further prevention and the fixing of responsibility as to
accidents.</p>

<p>I secured from the Commission the attached reports, which I shall
not read in detail, but which show detailed comparisons and some interesting
figures. (See reports, A, B and C, appended to this paper.)</p>

<p>Our commissioners have been called on many times to address conventions
and congresses regarding the law, and I can best state their
views by quoting from an address of Commissioner Pratt at our recent
Logging Congress, and from a statement issued by Commissioner Wallace.
Commissioner Pratt says in part:</p>

<p>“The Workman’s Compensation Act has been in operation now for
nine months, and those of you who are actively in business in the State
of Washington are more or less familiar with its results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“In the first place, it is compulsory alike on the employer and employe.
The employer has to pay into the accident fund a sum of money
based upon a percentage of his payrolls, and the employe must accept the
awards of the Commission allowed for work accidents in lieu of his right
to sue at common law, subject, of course, to a right of appeal on the
amount awarded.</p>

<p>“All the extra hazardous industries of the State are divided into
forty-seven classes, each class with a fund of its own, and the accidents
arising in that class shall be a drain only upon that fund. As the payments
for work accidents deplete the fund in each class it provides for
monthly assessments to be made to recoup each class. The payments out
of these funds are only for work accidents, all the cost of the administration
of the law being paid out of the general taxes of the State. For
the first twenty-two months of its operation an appropriation of $150,000
was made.</p>

<p>“It is unlawful for the employer to deduct any portion of the premium
paid into the accident fund out of the wages of the employe. It
provides for penalizing any establishment which from poor or careless
management is unduly hazardous by raising its rate. If an employer,
besides employing men in extra hazardous employment, employs men in
non-hazardous employment, the premium shall be paid only the payrolls
of the extra hazardous work, but the employer and the non-hazardous
employe may elect to come under the act and both shall receive the benefits
of the act.</p>

<p>“As each class must pay for only such accidents arising in that class,
and as assessments are made only as the funds of that class are depleted,
there are but two things that govern the cost of this insurance: the
amount of the awards and the number and seriousness of the accidents.</p>

<p>“As I have said, the classes that the loggers and lumbermen are most
interested in are seven, ten and twenty-nine.</p>

<p>“The rate for class seven is 5 per cent.; for classes ten, 2½ per cent.,
and twenty-nine is 2½ per cent. All operations in which those present
are interested in these last two classes take the same rate. Class ten is
by far the largest class we have, and as it covers several distinct operations
it has been divided into four different subdivisions or groups.</p>

<p>“10.1 covers logging and logging operations of all kinds.</p>

<p>“10.2 covers sawmills and lumber yards, etc.</p>

<p>“10.3 covers shingle mills and operations connected with a shingle
plant.</p>

<p>“10.4 covers mast and spar manufacture, stump pulling, land clearing,
etc.</p>

<p>“We have had the following table compiled of comparative risks of
wood-working industries:</p>

<p>“This table is not as nice a one as I should have liked to show this
Congress of Loggers. It shows where the great harm is being done in
class ten and it shows which is the greater risk and what part of the
class should be charged a higher rate than the other part. Furthermore,
not only are we keeping a strict account with each class, and division of
a class, but we are keeping a strict account with each individual operator
and in the end will publish an account of just how many accidents each
firm or corporation has had, just how much has been paid out for them
in awards or pensions, for injuries to their workingmen.</p>

<p>“Now, what are we going to do to prevent this loss of life and limb?
In the first place, there has been a Labor Commission since 1905 and the
mills and factories have been subject to inspection and have been forced
to put on safeguards. The loggers have steadfastly refused to allow
any inspection laws covering logging to be put on the statute book of the
State. Logging is a hazardous life at the very best and calls for strong,
dare-devil men, and men who are willing to take chances. Danger is
always present and men become so used to it that they get careless. This,
however, is no excuse for needless loss of life and limb.</p>

<p>“Once more I want to urge upon the lumbermen of all classes the
necessity of more rigid inspection; to have some one about the plant
whose sole duty is to see to it that every machine is safeguarded the
best that possibly can be, and that safeguards are kept in place. It
will be money in your pockets if you want to put it on such a mercenary
level as that.</p>

<p>“Also I want to urge that a movement be put on foot that our colleges
and universities establish chairs of logging and safeguarding
engineering, so that our young men, just fresh from school, shall have a
better knowledge to start with on these subjects than did their fathers.
Many and many a man-killing machine is used just because some one
has not invented a better one.</p>

<p>“The report of the expense of the Commission shows that the total
amount expended to July 1 out of an appropriation of $150,000 was
$87,062.14, and that the proportion of expenses to the amount of business
done is 11 per cent., a showing so much below what it costs casualty
companies merely to solicit their business as to be notable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>“The president of one of the casualty companies, while I was in New
York, showed me their experience, which showed that the cost to them for
the last year was 51 per cent. of the premium. As you see, our cost is
about 11 per cent. Of course, we do not have to solicit, nor do we have
so large a force in the field for adjustment.</p>

<p>“The Commission, is keeping well inside of its appropriation, as the
allowable average expenses for twenty-two months would be $6,818.18,
while the actual average has been $6,620.16.</p>

<p>“We are executing the law, backed by the State of Washington, and
there is less quibble in settlements made by our Commission than there
would be by an adjustment made by a casualty company. Neither do
we have to pay any attorney’s fees, as the Attorney-General’s office has
to attend to all this part of the work for us.</p>

<p>“Since the first of October, there has not been a case filed in any
court in the State for damages done to any workman who came under
this act.</p>

<p>“This has been a great relief to our courts, and in time will be felt
in reduced taxes. The cheapening of our court costs and the removal of
all personal liability suits should work a reduction of costs to the general
taxpayer.</p>

<p>“One of the features of the old common-law system was the ambulance-chasing
lawyer, whom we all know. This gentleman is practically
out of business as a result of the Workman’s Compensation Act, but is
undertaking to find some activity in the industry of appeals. Out of
over 6,000 claims passed upon, only twelve appeals have been filed, one
of them from the Imperial Powder Company, to interpret the law, one
to determine the scope of the interstate commerce law, one filed by an
insane claimant, and several that are in the process of adjustment and
dissolution.</p>

<p>“One appealed case has been tried in court and the court sustained
the Commissioner’s finding as far as temporary total disability was concerned,
but found the claimant entitled to compensation for permanent
partial disability, remanding the case to the Commission for additional
compensation, which was promptly awarded. Had the Commissioner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
been in possession of the facts, the award for permanent partial disability
would have been made without appeal.”</p>

<p>Commissioner Wallace makes the following pertinent statement:</p>

<p>“The Washington State insurance system has succeeded beyond the
best hopes of its friends and sponsors. In this act, one of the youngest
States is giving the older commonwealths another example of a wise and
progressive law. The State’s control over public utility corporations,
giving the suffrage to women, eight-hour laws for underground miners
and women wage-earners, full crew law for railways, and other laws
enacted during the past four years in the interest of labor deserve full
praise and should not be forgotten in the triumph of our compensation
act.</p>

<p>“The compensation act has thus ushered in an era of publicity regarding
the appalling maiming, dismembering and killing of workmen in
the mines, mills and workshops of our State. The great question just
now becomes not what we can give to pay for pain and suffering and
even death, but how can we best safeguard those who toil. This will
be real progress; compensation must ever be mere apology.</p>

<p>“Concerned as we have been as to how the little home flock could be
kept together when the breadwinner was stricken down in his endeavor
to make an honest living, and thinking in terms of dollars and cents
how much it will take to keep the wolf from the door during these times
of industrial disaster, we may have overlooked the fact (or was it because
we were not familiar with it?) that, according to the best authorities
who have made accident prevention a scientific study for a number
of years, 75 to 90 per cent. of the accidents that occur are preventable.</p>

<p>“Our law has been widely commended and is in reality the best compensation
law in the United States today. It has been rarely condemned,
save by those who profited by the old legal system. It has shown the
great waste of human energy, manhood and womanhood—wastes which
reflect discredit upon this young and virile commonwealth—and as these
things begin to be understood by the people they will insistently ask,
what can we do, not only to preserve the mineral, the timber, and the
water-power resources of our State, but what can we do to conserve our
greatest asset—human life?”</p>

<p>I am confident this Congress will endorse the sentiments expressed
and I only wish to add the employer and employe, State official and private
citizen, voice the same sentiments and desire to give them widest
publicity.</p>

<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—This is certainly a very important paper. I want
to say here that tomorrow, in Kansas City, Mo., a committee from the
organized labor interests, and a committee from the manufacturers will
meet to discuss a proposition to prepare a bill for presentation to the
next Missouri Legislature that shall be fair alike to employer and employe,
in regard to compensation for injuries. It has worked well in
Washington, it is humane, and it does shut off the dishonest, shyster
lawyer who means to get three-fourths or more of the award for the
injury, and gives it all to the person who is injured, without any attorney’s
fees. (Applause.)</p>

<p>I will take just a moment at this time to appoint the Nominating
Committee:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Nominating Committee</span></h3>
<p>George E. Condra, Chairman; E. T. Allen, H. A. Barker, Mrs. Marion
A. Crocker, E. G. Griggs, Mrs. Elmer E. Kendall, Henry Wallace,
and N. P. Wheeler.</p>

<p>This committee has the duty of considering and nominating the officers
for the next Congress. They will have a couple of days for the
work.</p>

<p>At the first day’s session, there was a report on the program from
the National Congress of Mothers, which was to have been presented by
Mrs. Orville T. Bright, of Chicago. Through an unfortunate misunderstanding,
which was not the fault of Mrs. Bright, she was not here on
the first day. We are glad to have the report at this time. I now take
great pleasure in introducing Mrs. Bright. (Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Report, Mrs. Orville T. Bright</span></h3>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bright</span>—The one object for the conservation of all the material
resources of a Nation is for the use, comfort and benefit of the homes of
the people.</p>

<p>It would be of little importance what became of forests, lands,
waters, minerals or food were there no men, women and children to use
and enjoy them.</p>

<p>Therefore, at the very heart of this Conservation work should be the
two departments covering homes and child life.</p>

<p>It has been a source of encouragement to see that men who are
leaders in many great developments of our land, have given definite
place to the study of the conservation of the home.</p>

<p>There is need for it if America is to be the greatest of all the nations,
for with its wonderful natural resources it can only be as great as the
quality and character of its people.</p>

<p>Great minds are needed to think and plan with wisdom and unselfishness
for the America that is to be, for the protection of homes that are
to shelter and nurture the men and women who a few years hence will
take our places.</p>

<p>The United States has its Departments of State and War and Navy.
It has not yet seen that the greatest questions it has to meet are the protection
and care of the American people and American homes.</p>

<p>The U. S. Department of Agriculture is educating the farmer to make
the most out of his land. It gives him information concerning the soils,
the rotation of crops, the protection against the many enemies of plant
life, the care and feeding of stock and poultry. It protects the forests
and the fisheries. All these things for the service of man have received
the guardianship of the Government.</p>

<p>Homes are just as important as farms, and there is just as great need
of proper consideration for their elevation and protection as there is that
of farms and stock and forests.</p>

<p>The protection of infant life is of more value, even in a pecuniary
way, than the protection of the cotton crop, yet three hundred thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
babies die annually whose lives might be saved if the United States gave
the same careful, intelligent information to the mothers as it does to the
farmers.</p>

<p>The annual sacrifice of three hundred thousand American citizens
from preventable causes is a waste far too great not to receive governmental
consideration. Time need not be wasted on compiling statistics.
There is need for prompt and decisive action to prevent this needless sacrifice;
it means that each year the possibility for at least one hundred
thousand homes of American citizens is cut off. That means a serious
loss to this Nation and one for which immigration can not compensate.</p>

<p>The wonderful advance in agriculture can be paralleled in human
culture if the same methods are used. The trains that go through the
country for agricultural demonstrations should carry instruction to both
men and women on home-making and child nurture. The list of valuable
educational pamphlets published and sent free of postage should include
instruction in child hygiene and sanitation.</p>

<p>There is today a need for a Home Department in the National and
State Governments that is equipped to study the home problems of
America and meet them as only can be done by thorough study and
knowledge of conditions, their causes and remedies. The sacrifice of
infant life is a small part of the waste that undermines the homes.</p>

<p>Juvenile crime, its causes and treatment are of more vital moment
than the boll weevil or the chestnut blight, for the possible good citizen
transformed into one who is a menace and expense to society is a great
waste.</p>

<p>There are countless organizations which give material and charitable
relief. There are few which give the help that will enable the average
home properly to guide and train the boys and girls who are wayward,
or will help parents to learn efficient methods of child nurture. The
home has the greatest power over human life and human character. Too
long has it been left to chance and ignorant experiment to make it efficient
in its work, stable and permanent.</p>

<p>The home is founded by the marriage of a man and a woman. It is
a matter of grave concern to the Nation when divorce breaks up one in
every twelve homes, and leaves the children bereft, not only of a normal
home but deprived of a true conception of what marriage and parenthood
should be. The conservation of the home requires that serious study and
work be done to change this condition in America. It can not be done
by legislation alone, though one of the greatest needs today for the protection
of the home is Federal law governing marriage, divorce and
polygamy.</p>

<p>It is a serious menace to the home when forty-four States may make
as many different laws as they choose on a subject which is the foundation
of the Nation’s future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>That a man may be legally married in one State, and that such marriage
is illegal in a State adjoining, that divorce is easy in some States
and difficult in others, that polygamy is permitted to continue in some
States, and that freedom to spread the cult is allowed, have all been
undermining influences in the God-given standards of marriage, home
and parenthood.</p>

<p>The Government has found it necessary to assume jurisdiction over
interstate commerce, railroads and express companies. It is of even more
vital importance that it should have jurisdiction over marriage, divorce
and their violations. In addition to this, there is need for definite plain
teaching of youth in regard to the true high ideal of marriage, of parenthood,
and the making of a home. This would prevent a large proportion
of the divorces. A standard should be set in regard to the home,
and boys and girls should get that as part of their education.</p>

<p>Ignorance of hygiene is responsible for the drawbacks and failures of
many homes. It is inexcusable that any boy or girl should be permitted
to reach manhood and womanhood without a clear knowledge of personal
hygiene, sanitation, and food values. This knowledge is essential to
good home-making and good parenthood, and is equally necessary for
men and women.</p>

<p>Congestion in cities should not be permitted. In the seaport cities
many immigrants from other lands have not the means to go farther, and
if they had the means, do not know enough about the country to place
themselves where their qualifications would fit best. The cry against
immigration is one with which I can not sympathize. The Americanizing
of the immigrant should be placed in other hands than the politician’s,
who uses him en masse for a manipulated vote.</p>

<p>The special education of immigrant men and women would be an
important service to good home-making and the ability to train the children
to be useful citizens.</p>

<p>The proper distribution of immigrants by careful information as to
opportunities for work and the earning of a home is greatly needed. The
proper assimilation of our immigrant population is still in its infancy,
but is of vital moment, for they also are the future citizens of America.</p>

<p>The city home of the American citizen should not be left to the will
of builders whose only thought is to build houses for sale. Many apartments
are built today without the amount of light, sun or ventilation
necessary to health. Some cities and towns are realizing the need for
regulating this.</p>

<p>The Conservation of the home demands that every State should have
requirements as to building homes. The problem of a comfortable home
for the family with a moderate income is a serious one today. Few
cities or towns are giving the thought necessary to make a city of good
homes for the average family at prices possible for them to pay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>The country home is equally in need of study and help. The opportunities
for social life and educational advantages equal to those given
to the city home should be supplied. That means larger appropriations
for schools, the employment of the best teachers, the consolidated school,
the use of the schools and churches as centers of educational and social
life, the making of good roads between home and school and church and
market place.</p>

<p>The Government Department of the Home should take all these
things into consideration. It should bring to the overworked farmer’s
wife better household facilities and more help. The greatest drawback
to country life today is the overworked wife, who can not get needed
help and who goes beyond her strength in cooking and doing housework
for farm help as well as her own family.</p>

<p>No one who knows of the terrible results of hook worm in the South
resulting from the unsanitary, poverty-stricken hovels, where physical
weakness had for years sapped the vitality and energy of men, women
and children, can gainsay the fact that Government study of the causes
and the remedy has done a service of inestimable value to thousands of
homes. Seven years’ life among those people proved that many of
them were in quality equal to the best American stock, but that disease
had brought upon them the unjust stigma of laziness with resulting
poverty.</p>

<p>The Government could study and publish the results of its investigation,
but Dr. Stiles had to get contributions from individuals to do the
educational and medical work necessary to uproot this disease. That is
not as it should be. The power to help should go with the power to
investigate, for the condition was of much wider interest than to the
individuals directly affected.</p>

<p>The National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations
have made the subject of the home, of parental education and of child
welfare its special study and work for seventeen years. It has worked
steadily to build up a united system of parent-teacher associations in
connection with every school, to bring about the co-operation of home and
school in child nurture.</p>

<p>It has required that these associations should be for child study so
that parents might have guidance and help in their problems. It has
instituted study courses and provided educational material for the parents.
It has headquarters in Washington and has valuable co-operation
from Government departments. It should be the Homes Department of
the National Conservation Congress because its work is well established,
covering every State and reaching to other Nations. It is the only
national organization whose membership is composed of parents and
teachers and whose educational leaders include the greatest specialists in
child nurture and child welfare in home, school, church and state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>I would suggest to the National Conservation Congress that it make
the National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Associations the
Homes Department, because in that way it will have consecutive work
of high standard, and will bring a strength which could be secured in
no other way. Co-operation without duplication brings results.</p>

<p>The National Congress of Mothers offers its co-operation in every
phase of conservation for which the Conservation Congress was organized.
It also asks co-operation of the Conservation Congress in its international
work for home, parenthood and child nurture.</p>

<p>It invites this Congress to be always represented at its annual conferences
and at the Third International Congress on Child Welfare in
Washington, D. C., in May, 1914.</p>

<p>Life, health, character, all depend on the home and its efficiency. To
equip every home for efficiency in its special work is the greatest need in
Conservation.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—That is surely a fine paper, in a holy cause.</p>

<p>The topic of the next section of the program is “Conservation of
Human Life.” The subject, “Saving Miners’ Lives,” will be discussed
by Dr. Joseph A. Holmes, of Washington, D. C., Director of the National
Bureau of Mines. (Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Saving the Miners’ Lives”</span></h3>
<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Holmes</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: Those of you
who have endeavored, even in part, during the past month to attend the
Congresses in session in the United States, have found the time all too
short to make that possible for you to do. These Congresses have covered
all subjects. There is a feeling of unrest, a feeling that we have
not done in the past the things which we ought to have done, and that
it is high time we were trying to find out what are the best things
to do. For some two hundred years in the development of this country
we have allowed the individual very largely to take care of himself.
We started out with the government theory that each man is entitled
to “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” and the individual was
left to himself to accomplish the purpose he had in view. The country
developed rapidly through that system, and we built up a great Nation,
but we have in the meantime neglected the public welfare. We are
in a state of unrest today in regard to the future, feeling that it is time
we were doing what we are trying to do—look after the question of the
public welfare.</p>

<p>We have had, furthermore, a period of most rapid progress. When
you, Mr. President, and others of us here, go back today to the schools
where we went years ago, we hardly know the place. Buildings have
changed, new ones have been built, and the teachers of today are different
from those we were accustomed to. We see the great system of transportation
built by the railroad men of today; we see the means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
communication, some fifteen million miles of telegraph and telephone
lines, enabling the people to talk with one another. Yet even that is not
speedy enough, so we are using the wireless. And so along all lines of
industry, we have developed at a tremendous rate. But it has been a
one-sided development, and now we have come to look particularly at the
other side—the public welfare, and we are trying to find out what is
best, from the experience of all countries, so that the American people
may do the best that can be done for the welfare of this country.</p>

<p>It has therefore come about, in connection with this one-sided development,
that we have lost sight of that great subject which we have for
consideration today—the conservation of human life. We have been
too busy to think about it. We have jumped on and off street cars
and railway trains; we have slipped on our waxed floors; we have
met with all sorts of serious accidents in our fast automobiles and
flying machines; yet we ask, “Why are these miners so careless as to kill
themselves, and these railroad employes?” And we are just as bad
as they are. So let us not talk about careless railway employes, or
careless miners, but stop to think what we can do to help the entire
situation. Let us ask ourselves the question, “Am I my brother’s
keeper?” and there is but one answer, and that is in the affirmative.</p>

<p>I want to call attention to the fact that we have in this country
two great foundations of industry. We have always considered agriculture
as the great foundation industry of the country, but we have
another—mining. The savage did not need any mines. He only wants
a limited amount of material for clothing, and a large amount of material
in the way of something to eat. He does not need the great modern
appliances which we have today. When we drew up the Constitution
of this country we did not think the mining industry of much importance,
and it was not possible to anticipate the great complex social
fabric which we have in the United States today. A man said to me the
other day that he thought if Thomas Jefferson could see the things that
we are asking of this great Federal Government, he would not know
what to do. My own judgment is that he would advocate the doing by
this Federal Government of all the things that this great American
people demand that it do today. (Applause.) The trouble is that while
we were making this tremendous progress, all of the people were not
keeping pace, and perhaps it is well that this is true, because if there
was nobody to hold back we would not only progress too rapidly, but
progress in too many one-sided ways.</p>

<p>We recognize, furthermore, that while agriculture has made tremendous
strides, and in large measure because of the investigations
conducted under the Federal Government, other branches of industry
have made rapid strides, but they have been forced to one-sided development
in order to keep pace. It needs, then, the great co-operating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
influence of some great force like the Federal Government to help keep
the industries from becoming one-sided.</p>

<p>The mining industry touches us on every hand, and today in a great
hall like this, where you can find materials from every part of the world,
you will find they came from the mine, or were manufactured through
the agency of the products of the mine. We can not do anything on
a large scale today without the aid of this great mining industry. During
last March, the English people awakened to a realization of that fact.
They did not consider mining as one of the great fundamental industries,
but the stopping of the coal mines for four weeks stopped all the
industries of the British, and they came to the conclusion that the very
life of the nation was in danger by the cessation of coal mining.</p>

<p>Mining and Conservation should be linked very closely together. Men
realize the fact that with agriculture, the resources increase year by
year. We increase the fertility of the soil by taking the nitrogen from
the air, and from that we get the crops, so that the wealth of the country
based on agriculture is easily predicated. The mining industry is just
the reverse. We started in this country with greater mineral resources
than we will ever have again. Furthermore, in agriculture we have the
healthiest vocation known, while mining is the most dangerous industry
in the world.</p>

<p>Now, this mining industry has increased so rapidly that we have
not been able to take care of many of the difficulties that have arisen,
nor do we have a realization of how rapid that increase has been. We
have increased in forty years from less than a ton to every man, woman
and child, to, in the last year, six tons. Forty years ago a pound of
iron, as compared with thirteen today for every man, woman and child.
And so it has been with the great industries—they are increasing so
much more rapidly than the population that it is hard to tell what has
become of this increase, and one of the questions is, can this increase
continue? Some of our great statesmen in Washington who have been
fighting this Conservation movement, say it can not continue. The fact
that the mining industry has nearly doubled every ten years, they say
can not continue. But no man today would say that this country will not
continue to grow, and as it grows this great mining industry will increase
also. We are just entering upon our development. We are just beginning
to export the products of our mines, so when we ask the question
whether this great Nation will continue to grow, and this industry will
increase, there is but one answer, and that is in the affirmative. We
ask another question—are these resources inexhaustible? And there
is but one answer, and that is in the negative, because we are now beginning
to see the end of some of these resources. Shall we curtail the
development of an industry like this and not supply the needs of the
people? Our politicians ask this and expect us to answer in the affirmative,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
but no conservationist answers it that way. We say, no, the needs
increase and we must meet the needs.</p>

<p>What can we do to perpetuate the welfare of the country? There
are but two things we can do, and they are fairly easy to do. Use more
and more efficiently all the resources, and prevent unnecessary waste.
Now, in connection with this wasteful use of our resources, you say,
after all, is there any great waste? What can we do to stop it? Only
a few years ago the State of Indiana thought its natural gas was gone,
so it passed laws forbidding the waste of natural gas; the Supreme
Court of the United States confirmed such an act in regard to coal—after
the coal was gone. One of the Supreme Judges said that a man
who owns a coal mine had a legal right to destroy it if he wished to.
But in the State of New York one of the associate justices overruled the
Supreme Justice, and in every case the Supreme Court of the United
States, as well as the Supreme Court of the several States, have shown
a desire to keep pace with the progress of this country in interpreting
the Constitution of the United States for the permanent future welfare
of the people of this country. (Applause.) There are a good many
signs of improvement, not only in what the Federal and State Governments
are doing, but in what private individuals are doing.</p>

<p>Only yesterday, I went through the great plant at Gary, and I found
the United States Steel Corporation was using two million horse-power
developed from gases from its own operations, which only a few years
ago was allowed to go to waste, and that power is not only operating all
the machinery of that company, but is supplying the power for other
industries in the immediate vicinity. I found that the slag coming from
the furnaces, which in many great manufacturing sections of the country
we see piled up in great, unsightly masses, is all being converted into
cement, and that cement is being used by the people of this country.
And so we find an interesting situation—that the steel being manufactured
by that plant is likely soon to be a by-product, and not the main
product for which the plant is operated.</p>

<p>And so it is when we watch the great industries of this country.
Under this great spirit of Conservation individuals are meeting the
Federal Government and State more than half way, and they are finding
what is the greatest basis of permanent success—that it pays to conserve
our resources. And when that great company does any mining
for ore in the lake country, instead of burying the materials which they
cannot use today, they are laying that material to one side, so that just
as soon as it becomes useful it will be immediately available for preparation
for that purpose.</p>

<p>Out of five hundred million tons of coal mined last year, we wasted,
by leaving it underground, no less than two hundred million tons.
Meanwhile, if we could have exported that coal to Central or South<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
America and brought back from these countries raw materials which
we could use in manufacture, it would be something worth doing; but
to waste it entirely is nothing more than a discredit to this nation. But
what are we going to do about it? The coal operator cannot change
the situation, because he is doing the best he can at the price he gets;
the miner cannot change the situation, because he is doing the best he can
at the price he is paid. It is not simply a question for chemists and
engineers—it is a problem for statesmen, and the statesman is the man
who must remedy the economic conditions.</p>

<p>To come to the main subject of the Conservation of life, the greatest
loss of life we have in mines is in the coal mining industry. I want
to say in connection with this, that a careful study of the situation for
the past several years has led me to believe that the coal operator in the
United States is just as humane and just as anxious to conserve the
life of his men as the coal operator in any other known country. (Applause.)
Furthermore, that while it is true that of the miners, less
than half read the English language and 75 per cent. are non-English
speaking and know little or nothing about the laws regulating the principles
and purposes of a great country like this, yet they are no more
careless in mining because of that fact than are the miners from England
and Wales who come here after long experience in mining and
knowing perfectly our language and customs. These men are up against
a condition that they cannot remedy, and while I do not say that they are
doing the best they can under the circumstances, I think they are
more and more coming to do the best they can, and I believe we will
have more and more effort on the part of both miners and operators
to do what is right. We have developed so rapidly in the past hundred
years that we have not stopped to think of human life, and we cannot
expect these reforms to take place without any effort on our part. There
is recognition on the part of both miners and operators, that I am my
brother’s keeper, and it is a most encouraging sign.</p>

<p>There are these two great reforms in connection with the mines of this
country—safeguarding the lives of miners and improvement of conditions
under which they labor, and the stopping of waste of our essential
resources. The Federal Government is trying to get at the actual information,
they are trying to conduct investigations in an impartial manner,
and they want to bring about a condition acceptable to both miner
and operator. We have suspicion on the part of the operator of the
miner; and suspicion on the part of the miner of the operator; and
suspicion on the part of other parties in reference to both. What we
want to do is to have a condition in this country so that the miner and
operator, co-operating with each other, can work together and bring
about these great reforms that are needed.</p>

<p>This general welfare clause of the Constitution, which was regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
as an agreement with the devil, is today our great saving clause for
getting things done by the Federal Government. The Federal Government,
Mr. President, has waked up long ago to what it ought to do for
agriculture, and in the next few years it will conduct investigations far
more extensive than today—it will submit remedies brought together
from the experience of all mining countries of the world, and it will
lead in this great movement for a general improvement of conditions.
But after all, what may be done by the Federal Government will depend
upon what is done by the Federal Congress. There is where we must do
our work, to make them appreciate the difficulties of a great industry
like this, and the correctness of this clause.</p>

<p>I want to say a word in behalf of these miners. As I said before,
more than half of them cannot read the English language. Under the
rules and regulations we have permitted these men to come into the
United States, and when they come it is interesting to see how they
appreciate becoming an American citizen. I talked to a Lithuanian
who had only been in this country a few months, and I said, “Are you
not very lonely?” and he said, “Yes, but I am an American.” (Applause.)</p>

<p>These men are here, and we have done mighty little for them. We
cannot wonder that they segregate in their rooms at night, after working
in the mines all day, and read Socialistic literature which comes
from their country. We do mighty little to encourage them to learn the
English language; we do mighty little to encourage them to enter into
the spirit of true America; we have neglected them all too long—and
then we complain that they are not American citizens. I appeal to you as
citizens of the United States and of the State of Indiana, to see that
everything that is possible is done to make good citizens of these men.
Get legislation under which they can work, and the safety problem will
take care of itself. (Continued applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The next subject for consideration is “The Prevention
of Railroad Accidents,” by Mr. Thomas H. Johnson, consulting
engineer of the Pennsylvania Lines, West. I take pleasure in introducing
Mr. Johnson. (Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Prevention of Railrod Accidents”</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnson</span>—In approaching this subject it will be well to get our
viewpoint adjusted to a true perspective and just proportion. Accidents
on railways which result in death or injury to persons, are all
reported to State and National officials, and when the statistics for the
year are compiled and published the total figures are startling, and
suggest that the transportation business of the country is conducted
at a fearful sacrifice of life and limb. It should be remembered, however,
that in no other line of the Nation’s activities are similar complete
statistics available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span></p>

<p>The only data at hand to show the relation between the numbers killed
and injured on railways, and those occurring in other lines of action, are
found in a pamphlet issued by the city of Chicago, entitled “Report of
the General Superintendent of Police,” from which the following table
is taken:</p>

<p>From this it will be noted that of 1,221 fatal accidents in 1911, only
187 occurred on steam railways, and of 16,516 nonfatal, only 554 are
charged against them. Comparing the total accidents, it will be seen
that five times as many persons were killed and injured on street railways
as on steam railways, four times as many by teams and vehicles, four
times as many by falls from windows, scaffolds, etc., and again four
times as many by personal violence. Even the dogs come in for having
done 73 per cent. more damage than the steam railways. Taking the
last two items together, it appears that Chicago’s vicious dogs and more
vicious men are nearly six times as destructive of life and limb as are
the railways.</p>

<p>While the foregoing figures are for the city of Chicago only, they are
indicative of the fact that throughout the country the number of accidents
on railways is a mere fraction of those occurring elsewhere, and
this fact has been recognized by the accident insurance companies when
they issue policies calling for double compensation if the accident occurs
while traveling in steam or trolley cars.</p>

<p>If the grand total of accidents on railways appears so startling when
presented in concrete figures, what would it be if equally complete
figures could be had for the other types of accidents classified in the
Chicago report?</p>

<p>And now having cleared the atmosphere in that respect, we will proceed
to consider the railway accidents on their own merits.</p>

<p>The Interstate Commerce Commission issues a series of quarterly
bulletins of railway accidents. They also issue an annual report of general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
railway statistics, in which a summary of statistics of railway
accidents was included prior to 1910, but which has since been admitted
as an unnecessary duplication. The statistics of the annual report have
been compiled on a somewhat different basis from those of the bulletins,
and the two sets of figures cannot always be reconciled. In compiling
the following tables the annual reports prior to 1910 have been followed
as being the final word of the Commission.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the statistics of railway accidents are divided
into two general classes:</p>

<p>First. Accidents due to the movement of trains, engines or cars,
which may properly be called “transportation accidents.”</p>

<p>Second. Accidents not connected with train or car movements, such
as happen to shopmen, warehousemen, trackmen handling material, etc.,
such as are equally occurring in other industries, and which are more
properly classed as “industrial accidents.”</p>

<p>This discussion will be chiefly devoted to the first class, as being
distinctively “railway accidents.”</p>


<p class="center">PROGRESS IN THE PAST.</p>

<p>The loss of life from railway accidents began with the day of the
opening of the first railway in England, in September, 1830, on which
occasion a prominent citizen, a member of Parliament, was knocked down
and fatally injured, sending a thrill of horror not only through the
great throng of spectators, but also throughout the civilized world.
That unfortunate accident was not due to any defect in track or equipment,
nor to any fault in the operation of the train. It was due to the
victim’s failure to appreciate the danger attending the then new and
novel mode of transportation, and inadvertently putting himself in a
position of danger. It was the forerunner and prototype of many thousands
of others which have since occurred through carelessness and sheer
recklessness of the victims, and which the railway companies are powerless
to prevent.</p>

<p>But as railways multiplied other accidents occurred, which were due
to defects of one kind or another in track and equipment, or to inadequate
rules governing train movements, and the duties of the several employes.
Each accident has been carefully studied as to its cause, and,
so far as possible, remedies have been applied. Thus the immense system
of transportation as it exists today has been a gradual development
from crude beginnings. The light iron rails inadequately secured at the
joints have been replaced with heavy steel rails with effective joint fastenings.
Train movements have been safeguarded by a well-digested system
of rules, uniform on all railroads; by standard forms of train orders
with all ambiguities of language eliminated, and by block signals, interlocking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
and automatic couplers, air brakes and other safety devices.
Stoves and oil lamps, with their menace of fire, have given way to steam
heating and electric lighting. The inflammable wooden cars are being
replaced with steel equipment. In fact, there has been a steady progress
from the beginning in the effort to reduce the danger to life and limb.</p>

<p>But accidents continue to happen, partly because the rapid growth
of traffic and the demand for greater speed are creating new conditions,
partly because materials have hidden defects and the human machine is
not infallible, and partly because discipline has been largely subverted
through the attitude of the brotherhoods of employes.</p>

<p>In order to show in a general way what has been accomplished, the
average figures for the five-year period from 1889 to 1893, inclusive, have
been compared with the corresponding figures for the years 1907 to 1911,
inclusive, with the following results:</p>

<p>Ratio of passengers carried to one killed has increased 35.5 per cent.</p>

<p>Ratio of employes to one killed has increased 54.7 per cent.</p>

<p>This shows a very decided gain in the twenty-two years covered by
the record.</p>

<p>The number injured cannot be compared in the same way, for the
reason that in the later years the reports include large numbers of minor
injuries of a more or less trivial nature, which were not included in the
earlier reports, but which the Interstate Commerce Commission now requires
to be reported, thus swelling the number injured out of all proportion
to the earlier reports. Under the present rules, if a passenger lets
a window sash bruise his finger, and it is brought to the attention of any
of the train crew, it must be reported, and enters into the final statistics
with as much weight as the loss of an arm or a leg.</p>


<p class="center">CAUSE AND PREVENTION.</p>

<p>In the Accident Bulletin for June, 1910, pages 10 and 11, there are
given detailed statistics of twenty-six “prominent train accidents” with
the causes of each. They embrace thirteen collisions and thirteen derailments,
resulting in sixty-two killed, 306 injured, and a property loss of
$261,584. The causes assigned may be grouped under fifteen heads, as
follows:</p>

<p>Excessive speed, 5; ran by meeting point, 2; failed to flag, 5; disobeying
orders, 1; misunderstanding orders, 1; failure to receive orders,
1; conflicting orders, 1; signal light out and engineman failed to stop, 1;
broken rail, 2; explosion of boiler, 1; spreading of rails, 1; washout, 1;
trestle failed, 1; insufficient ballast, 1; defective temporary junction of
new and old rails, 1. Total, 26.</p>

<p>These fifteen assigned causes may be summarized thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span></p>

<p>Failure of persons, 18; failure of boiler, 1; failure of track and
structures, 7. Total, 26.</p>

<p>Of the seven failures of track and structures, the two cases of “broken
rails” and one “washout” may be considered unavoidable. The remaining
four cases in that group, viz., “spreading of rails,” “trestle
failed,” “insufficient ballast” and “defective temporary junction of old
and new rails” were preventable, and could have occurred only from
neglect of those charged with their care and maintenance.</p>

<p>The one case of “explosion of boiler” may have been due to defective
material, or to negligence of the engineman.</p>

<p>We find, therefore, that in this group of accidents, twenty-two were
preventable, three unavoidable and one doubtful.</p>

<p>Of the unavoidable, the “washout” may be dismissed as being beyond
the control of human agencies, but the “broken rail” calls for
further consideration.</p>

<p>Rail failures are generally due to chemical or physical defects, not
entirely under control of the manufacturer, and not discoverable by inspection
of the finished rails. Under the present practice the manufacture
of rails is watched at the mill by the railway company’s inspectors.
Specimens from each heat or melt are tested under a weight of 2,000
pounds falling fifteen feet to twenty feet. If the test piece breaks the
steel is regarded as too brittle, and the rails from that heat are rejected.
If it does not break, but the deflection exceeds the prescribed limit, the
steel is too soft, and those rails are accepted as seconds, to be used only
in yards and side tracks. All test pieces which do not break under the
foregoing drop test are then broken and examined for internal defects.
If defects are found, further tests are made, and the heat rejected in
whole or in part, on the extent of unsoundness disclosed.</p>

<p>But herein lies a difficulty. Internal defects can only be found by
breaking the rail. A rail broken is past usefulness. Hence that form
of inspection cannot be applied to every rail; and as we can only test a
limited portion of each heat, some defective rails must inevitably be
passed and get into track. Complete statistics of all rail failures on a
large proportion of the railways of the United States have been collected
by the American Railway Engineering Association for several years past.
These reports have been collected and classified as to the several causes,
the results being printed in the publications of the Association. They
show that the rails which fail annually are less than one eighth of one
per cent. of the rails laid. This indicates fairly successful inspection,
and would be quite satisfactory were it not that a single failure may
result in such horrible consequences.</p>

<p>Five years ago (1907) as the result of several conferences between a
committee of the American Railway Association and the rail manufacturers,
a systematic study of the subject was undertaken, with a view to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span>
ascertaining the cause, and if possible, the prevention of rail failures.
This research work was placed in charge of the Rail Committee of the
American Railway Engineering Association, who engaged the services
of a competent expert, who devotes his whole time to the work, furnishing
freely of their materials and facilities at the mills. The line of
investigation includes studies of the effects of variations in composition;
in time in the bath; in time in the ladle; in manner and rate of pouring;
in size of ingot; in rate of reduction at each pass; in temperature
of the metal when rolled; in the effect of different alloys, etc. The field
of investigation is broad and complicated. Much progress has been
made, but much remains to be done. It is hoped, however, that success
will ultimately be reached, and the rail failures in service be reduced
to the lowest possible minimum. Certainly the railway engineers and
the manufacturers are making every effort to accomplish that result.</p>

<p>Of late the adoption of some form of automatic stop has been suggested,
and more or less urgently advocated. But let us consider: Referring
again to the list of causes of the twenty-six accidents, such a device
would have been called into play only in one case, that of running
by a signal when the light was out. It could have had no influence on
any one of the other twenty-five cases. Furthermore, it has been the
experience the world over that emergency devices, resting in “innocuous
desuetude” for long intervals of time, usually fail to work when the
emergency arises. It may be said that it should be some one’s duty to
see that the apparatus is kept in working order. Very true. But therein
is a reversion to ultimate dependence on the human factor with its attendant
weakness and frailties.</p>

<p>The foregoing list of accidents embrace only a few of the more prominent
“collisions” and “derailments.” But there are other forms of
accident, as shown in the following statistical tables copied from the
Interstate Commerce Commission Annual Report for 1909:</p>

<p>Referring to the column of totals under the head of “Employes” you
will note the large number of killed and injured in coupling or uncoupling
cars; this in spite of the fact that all the equipment is fitted
with automatic couplers, intended to prevent just those accidents.</p>

<p>The next two items, “Collisions” and “Derailments,” are also large,
both as to employes, passengers and others, and we have already seen
that in the former list eighteen out of twenty-six were due to “failure of
persons.” Referring again to that list it will be further seen that
sixteen of the eighteen were due to failure of the persons in charge of the
trains, which justifies us in assuming that a similarly large proportion
of these totals are due to like causes.</p>

<p>Please note also the large numbers, running through all these classes
of persons, opposite the items “Falling from trains, locomotives or cars”
and “Jumping on or off trains, locomotives or cars.” These may all be
charged to the carelessness of the victims.</p>

<p>So, also, those “Struck by trains, locomotives or cars” nearly all of
these are chargeable to the fault of the parties themselves.</p>

<p>“Other causes” are also prolific in casualties, but the data at hand
does not disclose the extent to which they are chargeable to carelessness
of victims or others, to preventable or to unavoidable causes.</p>

<p>Your attention is also directed to the very large numbers of killed and
injured while “trespassing” on the railway property. Some of these
belong to the great army of tramps infesting the country, but the largest
part are people of the communities along the lines, who persist in using
the tracks as a public thoroughfare. In most of the States there are
laws on the statute books which are adequate to prevent this if duly
enforced, but it seems impossible to get such enforcement. On the lines
with which the writer is connected, efforts have been made in the past to
break up this practice, but without success. Parties arrested by the
railway company’s police and taken before the local magistrate have
been released without punishment or only assessed a nominal sum to
secure to the magistrate his fees. A rigid enforcement of these laws, and
similar action as to jumping on or off locomotives and cars in motion (as
is done in Europe) would eliminate approximately one-half the total
killed and one-fourth the injured.</p>

<p>Here is a field in which the railways alone are helpless, but where
much can be accomplished by legal enforcement, supported by strong
popular approval. Without the latter, little aid can be expected from the
average country justice or city magistrate.</p>


<p class="center">INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS.</p>

<p>The first man to publicly call attention to the need of organized effort
in this direction was Mr. R. C. Richards of the Chicago and Northwestern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
Railway, in his booklet “Railway Accidents, Their Cause and Prevention,”
published in 1906. The seed thus sown has taken deep root, for at
the present time nearly every leading railway in the country has an
organized safety committee, whose duty it is to make regular periodic
inspections to see that work places and tools are in safe condition; that
yards, tracks, stations, buildings and grounds are clean and properly
lighted; that shop machinery is protected by safeguards over gearing and
other exposed moving parts, and that men are taking proper precautions
for the protection of themselves and others. They report upon conditions
which they feel can be improved, investigate accidents with a view to
preventing repetition, and recommend improved methods of work to reduce
risk of accident.</p>

<p>The Northwestern, after the first sixteen months, showed a decrease
of 23.7 per cent. in deaths, and 29.8 per cent. in injuries, compared with
the previous period of the same length. On the Pennsylvania Railroad
the result of the first eleven months was a decrease of 63 per cent. in
the combined number of deaths and serious injuries. These results are
most gratifying, and demonstrate the usefulness of such close inspection
and watchfulness.</p>


<p class="center">IN CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>Accidents due to washouts, and to hidden defects in material are in
the main unavoidable, though the former may sometimes be avoided by
increased care and watchfulness during and after storms, and it is
hoped that the latter may be materially reduced through the investigations
now in progress in steel making.</p>

<p>Accidents due to imperfectly maintained track can be avoided by better
maintenance, or by reducing speed to correspond to the conditions of
the track. Speed and track conditions are inter-dependent factors.</p>

<p>Accidents due to jumping on or off trains in motion, and to trespassing,
can be and should be eliminated by a rigid enforcement of existing
laws, or the passage of new ones, if those on the statute books are
found to be inadequate. As already stated, this would save one-half the
annual deaths and a large proportion of the injured.</p>

<p>Substantially all of the casualties in coupling and uncoupling cars
are due to carelessness of the men themselves, and the same may be said
of most of those due to falling from or being struck by trains, locomotives
or cars. It is difficult to suggest a remedy for this, or to formulate
a course of procedure to reform the men in this respect. Recent and
prospective legislation affecting the employers’ liability will not be conducive
to increased carefulness, but will rather tend to foster carelessness.</p>

<p>Train accidents due to error, negligence or incompetence should be
corrected by proper discipline. But the administration of discipline is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
restrained and obstructed by the brotherhoods, whose officers claim the
right to be present at all investigations, and the discipline ordered must
meet their approval. They contest suspension and dismissals by appeals
to higher officers who have no personal knowledge of the men, and use
every means at their command, even to threatening a strike, to prevent
the order from being carried out, often with success, all of which is subversive
of discipline.</p>

<p>It is not a comforting thought that, when you, here assembled, disperse
to your homes, some of you may place your lives in the hands of
a man who is retained in the service through intimidation, rather than
fitness and merit.</p>

<p>There can be no remedy for this while unprincipled demagogues and
politicians, catering for votes, continue to appeal to class prejudice, and
while the sympathies of the people, public officials and arbitrators seem
to be arrayed against the railways.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—We have now something else very interesting,
and the next speaker will only keep you fifteen minutes. I now take
pleasure in introducing Mr. A. B. Farquhar, of York, Pa., who will
speak on “Vital Statistics and the Conservation of Human Life a National
Concern.” He knows his subject; he knows it by experience; he
has been through it; and he has met the classes, met the conditions he
speaks of. He has a message to give you that is well worth hearing.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Vital Statistics and the Conservation of Human Life”</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Farquhar</span>—Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: Yes, I have
been interested in this subject for perhaps seventy years of the seventy-five
years of my life. I am very much interested in the work done in
Pennsylvania. I shall refer to that, as is proper in a man sent as a delegate
to this Congress by the Governor, and I believe it is a good example
to other communities.</p>

<p>Vital statistics are usually assumed to cover only the number of
births and deaths occurring in a given territory within a given time, a
subject not attractive to the general reader, but this address will be devoted
more particularly to the objects for which and the agencies by
which such statistics are assembled, which is far more important and
interesting, especially as it includes the social questions they resolve for
us. “It is sometimes said figures rule the world; but this at least is
true, that they show how it is ruled.” To this saying of a wise man
may be added that they also show how it might be or should be ruled;
they best illustrate “philosophy teaching by example,” because most
precise and definite in form of presentation. They are of most use when
applied to the most important interests of mankind, and have no higher
function than in bearing their part in safeguarding the nation’s health.</p>

<p>For its vital statistics the Federal Census Bureau has always had to
depend on data collected by local agencies, and of the imperfection of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
those agencies, and especially the large territory for which there were
none—no attempt to keep the official record of births and deaths, it has
loudly complained. Notwithstanding the commendable efforts that have
been made throughout the country to supply deficiencies by State legislation,
so much remains yet to be done that a census report, as late as
1907, showed less than half the population of the country, and only a
third of the States in number, within the registration area. But the
movement has been forward, and it is gratifying to note that the most
significant step in advance was made by Pennsylvania, in a law creating
a state department of health and fixing its duties in 1905. Until then
that commonwealth was said to have “the poorest registration of any
of the Eastern States,” though its first law for the purpose had been
passed fifty-four years earlier; but “it had in 1906, the first year of the
operation of the new law, an effective registration of births and deaths
practically as complete as that of any registration State in the country,
and far superior to the majority.” The best point about the law of 1905,
and its most significant difference from that of 1851, is that it is executed.
Obedience is no longer optional, but compulsory. Authority
under it is centralized in the hands of the Governor, Attorney-General
and Commissioner of Health, and practically for most purposes in those
of the Commissioner.</p>

<p>The total appropriations for work under this department since 1905
have been $9,286,080. The number employed by its various divisions is
3,625. Of this number there are 1,170, nearly one-third of the total force,
who are local registrars in the vital statistics service.</p>

<p>With what is so large a force to occupy itself? The 1,170 registrars
receive all birth and death certificates and issue all burial permits (to
which registration is a prerequisite), and the bureau has also charge of
marriage certificates, filed with it by the clerks of county courts. The
medical inspection division establish quarantine under direction of the
county inspectors, see to placarding houses and disinfecting them after
cases of communicable disease, guard against the sale of milk from premises
where any such diseases are found, and represent the department in
co-operation with local health boards. Supervision of the medical inspection
of schools forms also an important part of the duty of these officers,
some 300,000 children having been examined during the past school year.
At the free tuberculosis dispensaries, with which the department has provided
the large centers of population, the indigent receive free medical
advice and necessary supplies. The commissioner has supervision, by the
act creating the health department, of all systems of public water supply
and of public or private sewage disposal. Detailed plans must be
filed with the department, and no new construction can be done until the
Governor, the Attorney-General and the Commissioner have approved the
plans. The biological products division distributes, through 656 stations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
in all parts of the commonwealth, free antitoxin to the poor. The stations
are located as impartially as practicable.</p>

<p>What has been accomplished by all this equipment, discharging all
these functions, cannot be completely told; a few figures may be given,
with a result here and there, and the rest left to estimate of probability.
For example, the statement that 6,724 patients were admitted to the Mont
Alto Sanatorium in the four years 1907–1911 certainly indicates the
magnitude of the problem, and the importance of giving it the best attention
we can. It is perhaps a little more significant that 58,004 patients
have been treated in the department’s tuberculosis dispensaries since
they were organized. The activity of the sanitary engineering division
is clearly shown in its recorded count that up to June, 1912, 40,447 private
sources of stream pollution had been abated on notice from the
department. One hundred and eleven modern sewage-disposal plants
have been built or are in process of building, 306 municipal and private
sewer systems are under construction in accordance with plans approved
by the health department. Ninety-seven modern water filtration plants
have been or soon will be constructed under State approval. It is
worth while to connect with this fact another even more gratifying: the
death rate from typhoid fever in Pennsylvania, which was, in 1906, 565
per million inhabitants, had fallen to 206 per million in 1911. As a final
instance, the death rate from diphtheria, a little over 42 per cent. in
untreated cases, has been reduced in the average of the 35,111 cases
treated with antitoxin between 1905 and December, 1911, to 8.07 per
cent., or less than one-fifth. Further, a certain district having been
set apart for the trial of 5,000 units, instead of the usual 3,000, as an
initial dose of diphtheria antitoxin, the death rate in that district has now
shown a reduction to 4.22 per cent.</p>

<p>This story is not told for the mere satisfaction of praising our Keystone
State or its faithful and capable public officers, though for that,
too, it affords opportunity. Its function is to point a moral, to indicate
a course of treatment of the subjects of vital statistics and public health,
which, as Pennsylvania’s experience leads me to believe, may well be applied
to a wider field than Pennsylvania. It is not by accident that the
association of statistics of births and deaths and marriages, with a
State office for the promotion of public health, has come into favor at
the same time in so many parts of the country. The force of example
is something, to be sure, as is also the circumstance that a physician is
usually at hand, when a birth or death occurs, that he is apt to know what
there is to tell about the occurrence, that he is apt to know how to report,
and that the State health office is one to which a physician might naturally
address himself. But more important than these considerations is
the value of birth and death records in the conservation of the people’s
health. From the greater or lesser number they show the favorable or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
adverse effects of accompanying conditions can be judged, and a conclusion
reached as to how such conditions should be regulated. Nor could
any condition be more important to regulate than those affecting health.
The people’s health is its most precious asset. Dr. Wiley says he “would
rather be a strong, vigorous man without a dollar than a sickly millionaire,”
and thus indicates the pecuniary value of health to an individual.
Multiplying that value by the number of the population, the amount becomes
fairly appalling.</p>

<p>We have a department of agriculture expending vast sums—nearly
fifty millions in the last decade—in improving the soil, improving the
growth of vegetation, improving the health of animals, and no department
to do anything to improve human health. We spend $700,000,000
a year for past and imagined future wars, and pay no attention to the
700,000 calculated above—a larger number dying every year, unnecessarily
from disease, than bullets have slain since the continent was discovered.
As we are reminded by Dr. Dixon, our Pennsylvania health
commissioner, we are spending millions a year for the protection of our
forests and water supply and other natural resources, but it is no credit
to our intelligence that while guarding these material interests we allow
man himself, without whom all else is worthless, to remain unguarded.</p>

<p>Yet it is a mistake to say that we do and have done nothing; what has
been done is greatly to the credit of mankind, only it has not been
enough. Jenner’s discovery and his application of it has left no excuse
for smallpox anywhere. The president of the board of health in Mexico
assured me that compulsory vaccination had freed his city of smallpox;
and the Japanese health authorities, since their enforcement of compulsory
vaccination, have ceased altogether to look upon the presence of
smallpox as a source of danger. It is no longer a scourge in the Philippines
and Cuba. Similar to the work of Lister in antiseptic surgery is
that of Pasteur and Koch in various germ-diseases, of King and Carroll
and Lazier in mosquito-transmission of infection. With the elimination
of the Stegomyia mosquito, yellow fever is no longer dreaded; Havana
and the gulf ports are as safe as anywhere; and the construction of the
Panama Canal has become possible—as, but for the discoveries by Carroll
and Lazier (or their rediscovery of Dr. King’s discovery) it never could
have been.</p>

<p>From the brilliant successes attained in the directions just indicated,
we seem to see that the most important thing for us is to know; we are
to find our safety in knowledge. When we know that malaria is inoculated
by the bite of the mosquito Anopheles, and yellow fever by the
mosquito Stegomyia, that typhoid fever is fed to us, in a large proportion
of cases, from the feet of the house-fly, that the fearful bubonic plague is
inoculated by the bite of a flea infesting the rat, we have already traveled
more than half way to deliverance. We can drive off the mosquito,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
or, by oiling the puddles, prevent her from hatching; we can “swat the
fly,” or abate the manure-heaps and other filth from which it draws its
unblest being; and, if we can not catch the flea, we can make war upon
its host, the rat. If, as is computed, within the last 2,000 years 2,000,000,000
people have fallen victims to the bubonic plague, it is enough to
justify wholesale enlistments in a grand rat-hunt.</p>

<p>Half a century ago people were afraid of night air, and closed their
windows at night. It is hard to guess how many lives might have been
saved by opening those windows. We are told that the average duration
of human life has doubled in the last 200 years. Whatever gain there
has been is due, more than anything else, to more knowledge.</p>

<p>The case of pure air as against contaminated air is but one way of
putting the general case of cleanness against foulness. Bad air has the
same vices that attach to dirt in other forms; one of the uses of more
knowledge is to be able to detect dirt in all forms, however concealed or
disguised; and another is to discover the best means of sweeping it away.
Our ancestors used to drink water from pools and wells that were sinks
of organic filth, to worship in churches built over an array of corpses in
all stages of putrefaction, to wear the same suit of leather clothes, day
and night, till they fell apart or the wearer outgrew them—all because
they knew no better. They had no conception of the disgust with which
such habits were to be regarded by a more educated posterity. Now the
golden rule of health is “Wash you—make you clean!” It is not enough
to make, or even to keep, the children’s faces clean; we must look no less
to the cleanness of the lung passages, of the alimentary canal—yes, of
mind and heart also.</p>

<p>Morally and esthetically, there is nothing in relation to which the
duty to be clean is more stringent than the reproductive function. The
source of the greatest work in all God’s creation, the human race, ought
more than all else to be pure; and the necessary condition of our endowing
the earth in coming ages with a better human race than it now has,
or has ever had, is that we provide that coming race with the best kind
of parentage. The quality of the next generation is determined by the
quality of this generation; it will be in most respects as we make it, clean
if brought forth in purity, foul if engendered in foulness. And the truth
so strikingly evident in the moral and esthetical view is even more clear
in the view we are here taking, that of the race’s health. To sexual impurity,
by the testimony of the best physicians—the illustrious Dr. Osler
for instance—more physical degeneration is due than to any other one
cause. Dr. Prince A. Morrow, president of the Society of Sanitary and
Moral Prophylaxis, estimates the number constantly ill from syphilis in
this country—although that number has of late been considerably reduced—as
still no less than 2,000,000. The syphilitic poison is communicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
by inoculation—a contagion that has no danger for us so long
as held at a respectful distance; and the essential point in guarding
against it is to preserve that distance. Like the venom of the rattlesnake
it is best known in a knowledge of its lurking places. It was first
recognized in Europe, some time in the fifteenth century; and it came
from the Orient, not of its own initiative, but because Europeans went
after it and fetched it. Similarly now, a man does not have it
unless he goes after it. There is nothing in the whole range of
human disorders that shows more emphatically than this, the
feebleness and inadequacy of the best possible cure as compared
with prevention. Knowledge seems all that is needed for
complete prevention; any young man, having more than the resolution
and self-control of an infant or an idiot, ought to require nothing more
than an elementary acquaintance with a few facts that should be at the
command of every instructor of youth, to insure his leaving the syphilis
and gonorrhea factory permanently alone. If their baleful function
were made clearly known to those who most need to know it, the entrance
door to every such temple of moral and physical ruin would carry to the
eyes the sign that greeted those of Dante: “All hope abandon, ye who
enter here”—a prospect whose unrelieved blackness looks even darker
when contrasted with the brilliant glory of the hope relinquished. It is
a law of our human constitution that the richest, deepest, keenest joys
that life has for us are those that come from the contrast of two sexes.
Even when that contrast is hostile, there seems to be some pleasure in it;
but immeasurably more when it is an incident of ardent attraction.
Byron in one of his earlier poems thus puts it:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry fs80">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Devotion wafts the mind above,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But Heaven itself descends in love;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A feeling from the Godhead caught,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To wean from self each sordid thought;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A ray of Him who formed the whole;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A glory circling ’round the soul!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is too well known that the poet’s own loves, in after years, were
not always of this ideal quality; but no one ever better set forth the exalted
possibilities of the sex sentiment, to which the continuance of life
on earth is due. But the worst, we are often reminded, is the corruption
of the best, and it is another possibility of the same sentiment that it
may urge a man to blast his whole future by incurring an incurable disease,
and sadder yet—too often to involve others, tender and innocent
lives, in his own condemnation. If more knowledge can ward off such a
grisly fate, it is surely inhuman cruelty not to supply that knowledge,
however disagreeable the duty may appear. When clearly seen as a duty
it will be no longer disagreeable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span></p>

<p>While making this call for more knowledge of vital truths primarily
on account of the young men, since it is in the vast majority of cases the
man who tempts, the man to whom the outcast woman owes her fall, it
would be the wildest folly to stop with one-half of the rising generation.
The future of the race is too dependent on its mothers to excuse or
permit the neglect of any preparation of them for motherhood, which
health in its fullest sense may demand.</p>

<p>Most of the great questions of health in its widest sense, of health as
a public concern, resolve themselves into resisting the entrance of this or
that species of bacterial germs into the body. The essential distinction
between Mother Earth, that bringeth forth flowers and fruits, and grass
for our herds, and dirt or filth, the especial opprobrium of the hygienist,
is that the latter carries germs of bacteria. Cleanness, in the hygienic
sense, is freedom from pathogenic germs; and when the doctors tell us
that the marked improvement in health conditions recently observable
in Germany and Switzerland, and pre-eminently in Sweden, is due to
their exceptional attention to cleanliness, they use the term with particular
reference to the provoking causes of preventable sickness. Not only
is the death rate from the acute diseases in those lands rapidly falling
off, but diseases of the chronic class are beginning to yield to the inculcation
of better habits among the people.</p>

<p>We are by no means without instances in this country, of death rates
reduced by preventive methods, as shown for young children in our
largest cities after the introduction of pasteurized milk. Deaths have
been thus spared for that peculiarly helpless class of sufferers, to the extent
of fully 50 per cent. in some districts—in large measure through the
well-directed activity of one public-spirited New York merchant. But
we have much to do in other lines, and we have only begun to free ourselves
of the typhoid fever incubus. As late as fourteen years ago there
were 11,000 cases of that infection in the camp at Chattanooga, with 800
deaths. In the entire Spanish war the deaths of our soldiers from diseases,
it was calculated, were thirteen times as many as from wounds in
battle—the diseases mostly, like the Chattanooga typhoid, of the preventable
kinds.</p>

<p>Loss of life by preventable accidents, on railways, in factories and
mines, is too closely associated with that by diseases to be here omitted,
though entitled to much fuller treatment than we can here afford. The
deathroll from this cause is still disgracefully large in this country, far
surpassing any country of Europe; but there are signs already of diminution.
For instance, one steel factory, reporting 43 accidental deaths
among 6,000 employes in 1906, showed only 12 fatalities in a payroll of
7,000 in 1909, safeguards having been introduced in the meantime. This
instance is very good, so far as it goes, but we need to make much more
progress in the same direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span></p>

<p>What we want is systematic effort, by some powerful consolidated
agency, to promote the conservation of human life. We have no need
to find fault with any of the organizations now engaged in furthering
that end, several of which are doing good work. We may gratefully
acknowledge the aid of the various medical societies, “regular” and
“irregular”—though we take the liberty of wishing that they might fight
the common enemy a little more and each other a little less. We may
also welcome the assistance of the life insurance companies, notably the
Equitable and the Metropolitan, whose managers clearly realize how their
interests are involved. Whatever lengthens the average term of human
life is a factor operating to increase their dividends and to reduce the
cost of insurance to their policyholders. It is worth while to note, at
this point, that the majority of life insurance officers are strong advocates
of the formation of a national bureau or department of health.</p>

<p>Still more do we owe to the activities of State and municipal boards
of health, which do more good because they have more power. Where
properly supported they have done a great work, at obstructing the
spread of epidemics by quarantines and other methods of isolation, at
curing pollution of water supply, at instituting improved sewer systems,
at bettering the general food supply by inspection of markets. You have
just heard a condensed account of the activities of one of our best State
health departments, that of Pennsylvania. You will infer from what
that department has done in seven years what might be done by a
national bureau or department, with powers and field of operation extending
over the entire country.</p>

<p>The movement for a bureau or department of health, national in its
scope, has been most actively advanced in Washington by Hon. Robert
L. Owen, Senator from Oklahoma. His bills call for a department, and
he gives strong reasons for the view that such an organization would,
while that of a bureau would not, suffice for the national governmental
activities in behalf of the public health. President Taft strongly urges
a “Bureau of Public Health,” and plainly intimates a preference for
the bureau plan. The “Committee of One Hundred on National
Health,” formed by the Association for Advancement of Science, in 1906,
with Prof. Irving Fisher as its president, originally contemplated a department
whose head should be a member of the President’s cabinet, but
it has in its recent publications adopted the alternative phrase “bureau
or department,” which course is here followed, because there is manifestly
nothing to gain by keeping up a contest on the point. The
memorial prepared by the committee of one hundred proposes for a
national department of health certain functions, as follows:</p>

<p>1. Administration—Including the national quarantine work, and
whatever regulation of interstate commerce might affect human health,
such as meat inspection and enforcing the food and drug act.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span></p>

<p>2. Co-operation—The work of assisting State, county and city health
agencies, after some such fashion as the National Department of Agriculture
co-operates with State agricultural colleges and institutions.</p>

<p>3. Research and Investigation—The work of obtaining needed scientific
information concerning the cause and prevention of diseases that
now shorten or impair human life; this would include a study of accidents,
of poisonous manufacturing trades, of hygienic conditions in
schools, etc., just as yellow fever was studied in Cuba, as the hookworm is
now to be studied under private endowment, as the work of the Pasteur
Institute was conducted under French government support.</p>

<p>4. Education—The work of supplying to the country scientifically
established data on matters pertaining to health, such work as is done
by the “publication division” in most of our governmental departments;
thus rendering available for practical use the work of research and investigation.
The countries in which is found the most rapid reduction
of the death rate are just those (Sweden for example) in which the
spread of a knowledge of hygiene is widest.</p>

<p>Of these functions the mere statement is a most powerful argument
for the bureau or department suggested. It only remains to remove a
few misunderstandings. One objection, for example, is powerful in
many minds—that such a centralized office must necessarily be the organ
of a particular medical school, and must so give that school—the one denominated
“regular,” for example—an unfair advantage, unsuited to a
government of liberty and equality. To this it may be frankly replied,
that the primary objects of the new office being the four just stated (administration,
co-operation, investigation, education), it would aim to collect
and diffuse the greatest attainable amount of accurate knowledge on
the subject of health; and that if it found a larger quantity of better
knowledge in one school than in another, it would be false to its trust
if it did not spread that knowledge accordingly. Personally, the writer
finds it hard to believe that it could treat a school that taught the unreality
of disease, or the surpassing value for all kinds of disorders, of
drugs, of a narrow range of characteristics, on an exact equality with
schools that deal with facts as they find them; but he heartily agrees
that the citizen ought to enjoy the liberty of choosing his own medical
advisers, so far as he does not endanger life or health by so choosing.</p>

<p>There are other objections to organized national work for health,
many of them from a so-called National League for Medical Freedom,
the most active workers in which have been shown to be interested in one
or another kind of proprietary medicine, backed by some “mental healers,”
and by associations of druggists who object to the “pure food and
drugs act” of 1906. Several homœpathical State societies have repudiated
that “league for freedom,” and have emphatically attested their
approval of the proposed bureau or department of health; this, notwithstanding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
their well-understood grievances against “regular” practitioners.
Some of the best informed among the osteopaths and the Christian
Scientists are pronouncing similarly; and so, if the disavowals keep on,
the League of Medical Freedom may soon be left with only those who
seek freedom to dope their victims with drugs that enslave; stupefy them—infant
and adult—with opium and thinly disguised alcohol, and generally
to reverse the progress of a century. But, since it is estimated
that $75,000,000 a year are expended by our fellow-citizens for patent
medicines, it is easy enough to see how they must regard a national department
which is to improve the sanitary conditions of the country,
show people how to care for health, stop the sale of poisonous nostrums
and impure foods, and end the career of opium under the name of
“soothing syrup.” Their profits would be gone, and of course they disapprove
and protest.</p>

<p>Altogether, the cause of a national bureau or department of health
is commended, both by those who favor and those who oppose it. It
could not ask better advocates than the distinguished men who heartily
favor it, on the congressional or the collegiate stage; nor more suitable
adversaries than those constituting the League for Medical Freedom.</p>

<p>I will now introduce to you the gentleman who kindly gave his hour
to Mr. Farquhar. He is Mr. Reginald Pelham Bolton, of New York
City, who will speak to you on “The Prevention of Elevator Accidents.”</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Prevention of Elevator Accidents”</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bolton</span>—The preservation of human life and the protection of
our fellow-creatures from physical injury, claim prior consideration over
conservation of mere materials.</p>

<p>Any form of danger which results in the destruction of life, and exhibits
a tendency toward increased developments, invites our systematic
investigation. Ameliorative measures, if undertaken in advance of the
growth of an evil, are of double value. To one phase of the subject, of
the conservation of life, I desire to direct your attention.</p>

<p>The increase of fatalities and injuries resulting from the extensive
use of passenger elevators has become sufficiently marked to deserve careful
attention by those who are concerned with the benefit of our fellow-citizens.
Complete statistics as to the number of accidental occurrences
in and about elevators of all classes throughout the country are not
available, but an estimate based upon such official returns as relate to
labor alone, indicate that the annual total is now probably in excess of
seven thousand, of which probably three-fourths are of a preventable
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span></p>

<p>From small beginnings, the roll of such accidents reported by the
New York Department of Labor, which it is conceded do not cover all
such occurrences, rose in 1909 to a total for five years of 1,600 injured
persons, of whom 198 were killed and about 298 permanently disabled.</p>

<p>The Wainwright-Phillips Commission of the New York State Legislature
reported in 1911 a list of injuries and deaths, in the three years
1907 to 1910, affecting 1,108 persons, of whom 106 were killed and 241
were more or less seriously and permanently crippled. In addition, no
less than 200 persons fell down hoistways, of whom 43 were killed outright
and 19 permanently injured.</p>

<p>These occurrences took place only on elevators in industrial establishments,
and are only those which have been officially reported.</p>

<p>The Industrial Commission of the State of Wisconsin reported for the
ten months, September, 1911, to June, 1912, thirty-nine accidents in and
upon elevators, and fifteen more due to falls down elevator shafts; all
occurring in establishments of various industries. Accidents occurring
in transportation were 195, so that the relation of elevator accidents and
falls was 28 per cent. of transportation.</p>

<p>That such accidents are duplicated outside the limits of observation
of labor departments is indicated by an examination of the reports of
the New York county coroners, which show about one hundred deaths
annually from elevator accidents in the county of New York only. In
the year 1911, in the Borough of Manhattan, there were reported sixty-eight
fatalities in connection with elevators, about two hundred permanent
injuries, and probably about three hundred more may be estimated
as having sustained lesser injuries.</p>

<p>The fact that accidental occurrences in or about elevators are thus
found to be deplorably numerous and increasing is not to be taken as a
reflection upon the general security of elevator travel. Their number is
relatively small in comparison with the vast number of persons utilizing
these appliances. One express schedule elevator handles about 700,000
persons per annum. Further, by far the larger number of mishaps are
not due to failure or fault of the elevator itself, but occur in and about
the entrances of, or in the hoistways of such apparatus, from persons
falling through unguarded openings into elevator shafts, and of course
a number are due to the recklessness and incompetence of employes and
operators.</p>

<p>It remains the fact, however, that a large part of these occurrences
are unnecessary, just as was found to be the case with many of the forms
of danger to life and injury to limb which attended the operation of
freight and passenger trains prior to the adoption of certain of the
safety appliances and methods which have been brought into general use
on railroads, as a result of the concentration of public attention upon the
subject, and legislative action based thereon. Similar attention and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
action with the compilation of statistics upon the subject will undoubtedly
result in diminishing the number of fatal and injurious occurrences
connected with elevator operation.</p>

<p>Some loss of human life and injury to the person may to some extent
be regarded as an unfortunately inevitable accompaniment of all forms
of motive apparatus, and the complex conditions of modern existence
have not only increased this liability by demands for more rapid movement
of all forms of mechanical transportation, but the vast increase in
the usage of appliances has introduced new elements of danger.</p>

<p>In no class of transportation are the effects of haste and crowding
more apparent and dangerous than in the modern means of vertical transportation,
use of which is now made by all classes of people. Liability
towards accidental occurrences in elevators, therefore, affects the whole
public, and it is needless to dilate upon the general concern in, and
economic loss resulting from deaths or injury of any member of the
community. It may be conservatively estimated that the economic value
of the mere services of persons killed in and about elevators, based upon
life expectancy, and the loss of time of those injured, would annually
exceed the cost of equipment of all passenger and freight elevators with
modernized safety appliances.</p>

<p>There are some features connected with elevator accidents which call
for consideration and rectification. These have grown up around the
development of the appliance in a manner somewhat peculiar to it. The
elevator is a transportation apparatus which is for the most part privately
operated and owned. Unlike the railroad, it is not regarded by
the law as the apparatus of a common carrier. Unlike the road carriage
or car, it is not operated upon the public highways. Unlike the machinery
of a factory, it is not utilized exclusively by employes.</p>

<p>Its development and use have been, perhaps, too restricted to require
the attention of such legislation as has been rather freely applied to the
other classes of appliances engaged in transporting human beings.</p>

<p>It has therefore come about that the legal status of the elevator is in
a very indefinite condition, its public regulation is generally local and
therefore at best erratic, and the liability for the security of its occupants
is as varied as the legal practice and rulings of different States.</p>

<p>The results are unfortunate to all concerned except perhaps that part
of the legal profession which concerns itself with the prosecution of
claims for injuries. Only two States, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island,
have adopted legislative provisions, of limited character, relating to elevators.
The former State provided so long ago as 1895 a requirement
for automatic locking devices on all passenger elevators, thus being the
pioneer in this direction. The State of Rhode Island by its general law,
Chapter 129, requires all elevators “to be equipped with safety appliances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
to prevent the starting of the elevator car in either direction while
any door opening into the elevator is open.”</p>

<p>The State of Wisconsin, by its Industrial Commission law, Chapter
485, of 1911, placed in the hands of that body general power to require
safeguards “in all places of employment,” but it does not appear that
the powers of the act extend to every class of building in which elevators
may or can be employed. Other efforts have been made to effect
legislation in the same direction, but have so far failed of enactment.</p>

<p>A bill was introduced in the House of Representatives December 12,
1910, by Mr. W. Bennet, requiring all elevators in the District of Columbia
to be provided with gate and car interlocking devices, which bill did
not become law. A bill was introduced in 1911 into the Assembly of the
State of New York amending the labor law in the direction recommended
by the Wainwright-Phillips Commission, and empowering the Commissioner
of Labor to require automatic door-locking and car interlocking
on all passenger elevators in factories. Senate Bill 911 and Assembly
Bill 329 of 1911 were designed to require in general terms the use of
“such safety devices as will prevent accidents to persons getting on or
off elevator cars and from falling through open doors into the elevator
shafts.”</p>

<p>The attention of the American Museum of Safety has been directed
for some years towards the accomplishment of some amelioration of existing
conditions, and that humane organization made a strong effort to
arouse public interest in these measures and to secure their enactment,
but without success.</p>

<p>The subject has received some sporadic attention by several public
associations, including the National Civic Federation, the American Association
for Labor Legislation and the New York Association for Labor
Legislation, but without effective results.</p>

<p>With the foregoing exceptions, the obligations of an owner of a
building, as regards the security of an elevating appliance, are practically
limited to a compliance with the then existing local regulations
to the purchase of a device commensurate with the existing state of the
art, of a design made by a reputable concern, and to the employment of
reasonable care in upkeep and operation.</p>

<p>No legal obligation appears to lie upon an owner to alter or modify
the appliance in conformity with greater knowledge of the art, or to add
to it greater means of security. Until some unfortunate occurrence has
taken place, an owner of property naturally feels unwilling to embark
on such expenditures. The present system of liability insurance rather
tends to such a situation, as an owner has no inducement in the form
of reduced premiums, to expend money upon desirable safeguards. If
the liability corporations should concede a substantial reduction of premiums,
in connection with appliances dealing with a certain proportion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
of the risks attending elevator operation, much could be accomplished
without the aid of special legislation.</p>

<p>While the law-making powers do not hesitate to direct such measures
to be taken with and upon the property of common carriers, they seem
to regard the operation of a practically public conveyance within private
property as a privileged possession and hesitate to enter the castle
of the owner and involve him in enforced expenditures upon a privately
operated appliance.</p>

<p>Yet an elevator, whether used for the purpose of the carriage of
goods, of tenants, of employes, or of visitors to a building, is a common
carrier earning a profit, even if indirectly, for it is as much a source of
revenue as is the machinery of a factory around which many enforced
safeguards have, by legislation, been thrown.</p>

<p>If, therefore, the owner of a building installs elevators for the convenient
carriage of tenants and visitors within his property, he does so
because the apparatus enhances the value of that property, and that
enhancement is largely due to the public use of the appliance, in which
use the unknowing users have some right to legislative protection from
results of ignorance or incompetence, of neglect or parsimony.</p>

<p>It has taken a long time for this view of the matter to become even
partially recognized, even in the city of New York, in which the use of
elevators has multiplied beyond all conception of what seemed probable
twenty-five years ago. The number of passenger elevators in the
Borough of Manhattan alone, now exceeds nine thousand, and these increase
annually by about five hundred new machines. The estimated
number of freight elevators, none of which under present circumstances
are subject to official inspection, is not less than ten thousand.</p>

<p>The regulations regarding elevators in Manhattan, commencing with
feeble beginnings, have advanced under the careful direction of the present
Superintendent of Buildings of Manhattan, Rudolph P. Miller, C. E.,
into the field of interference with private control, and the department is
compiling further regulations which will go a long way towards the protection
of the public in safeguarding the elevating apparatus they are
compelled to use. The Manhattan regulations, while in themselves excellent,
are directly applicable to passenger elevators only with such
freight elevators as are within the same shaft enclosure as a passenger
elevator. They require the operator to be of reliable and industrious
habits, not less than eighteen years of age, with at least one month’s
experience in his duties.</p>

<p>A number of known elements of unsafe character are prohibited and
some constructive features of value are insisted upon. No provision is,
however, made for automatic interlocking of gates and car movement,
nor are projections in the shaft prohibited. Some good, detailed regulations
and suggestions have been issued by the Wisconsin Labor Commission,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
but these and other State and local regulations could be substantially
increased in value, by a thorough technical investigation and settlement.</p>

<p>Some improvement of deficiencies in apparatus existing prior to these
rules has been effected by requiring safeguards to be applied upon any
alteration or large repair work being sanctioned. This course has
brought about the addition of speed safety appliances in a number of
old installations where this elementary security was absent.</p>

<p>Later regulations will, in similar manner, require carefully conducted
tests of all machines whether new, altered or repaired. Many
minor matters of security are or will be thus provided for, yet the limited
powers of a bureau can but at best halt in dealing with the entire
problem. And when the regulations of Manhattan are made, as they
should be, the best possible, it is regrettable that in another city or even
in another borough of the same city, the same desirable conditions will
not apply.</p>

<p>Yet the security of an elevator requires the same measures of attention,
in one State as in another, as much in the merest hamlet as in the
great metropolis.</p>

<p>The use of elevators is now widespread through all States, and in all
classes of buildings, affecting the convenience and security of all classes
of persons; and calling for the establishment of well considered and
equalized regulation in every part of the country.</p>

<p>It speaks volumes for the sense of responsibility of our leading manufacturers
of elevators, that among all the tens of thousands of machines
turned out by such concerns as the Otis Elevator Company and their
competitors, accidents due to the physical breakage of the machinery of
elevators should be in number only what they are, when they include the
failures of machines built in days when the industry was small and the
art far less understood than it is at present.</p>

<p>When we reflect upon the fact that the passengers carried in elevators
in the city of New York far exceed in number those carried on all
the surface and subway lines, we may the more appreciate the point to
which I desire specially to direct your attention, namely, the desirability
in the public interest of State regulation, and as far as possible, uniform
regulation, of the security and operation of elevators. The local regulations
may be left to care for details of installation but the State authority
is necessary to require elevators to be not only modern but progressively
modernized appliances; that no antiquated and essentially dangerous
apparatus shall be continued in use, and that necessary safeguards and
properly qualified operators shall accompany their operation.</p>

<p>The State may further require that in excessively tall buildings,
where the elevators constitute the only practical means of egress in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
emergency, there shall be a proper sufficiency of such appliances capable
of removing the occupants within a reasonably safe period of time.</p>

<p>The limitations of the carrying capacity of an elevator are now well
understood, and the safety of operatives in high loft buildings and of
tenants in loftier “tower” office buildings, demands that the parsimony
of owners and the ignorance of architects should not be allowed to restrict
the exit of occupants of such buildings. A second elevator, in the
Triangle fire disaster, would not only have saved its capacity in human
occupants, but would have averted the fatal overcrowding of the single
car which rendered it practically of no avail.</p>

<p>Many loft buildings of twelve stories and some even exceeding
twenty stories are in existence in which the elevator accommodation is
utterly inadequate for the removal of occupants of upper floors in a
reasonable time, in case of emergency. The effectiveness of exterior
“fire escapes” and of crooked interior stairways, especially for great
heights, is now known to be strictly within certain limitations, and
elevators have on many occasions demonstrated their value in the saving
of life in panic and fire.</p>

<p>Office buildings are constructed thirty and more stories in height,
without fire escapes and with winding stairways which are useless in
emergency, and with such limited elevator capacity as would not remove
the tenants in less than thirty minutes.</p>

<p>A most important and desirable subject for general action is afforded
by provisions for safeguarding elevator gates and doorways. In and
about these orifices, as previously observed, a large proportion of unnecessary
accidents and fatalities occur. The unlatched door, the open
gate, the absence of inner gates, the projecting sill, and the slippery
tread, are fruitful causes of deplorable injuries and have caused the
unnecessary loss of many precious lives. The proportion which this
class of occurrence bears to the total is evidently large. An analysis of
a list of four thousand accidental occurrences shows the following proportions:</p>


<table class="autotable fs80">
<tr>
<td class="tdl"></td>
<td class="tdl">Per cent.</td>

<td class="tdl">Unexplained</td>
<td class="tdr">1</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>A number of devices have been developed during recent years, which
have overcome objections to their use in the past, whereby the gates of
elevators must be securely locked and fastened before the car can be
moved. Six of such devices are approved for use in the State of Pennsylvania.
It would seem that so simple a feature eliminating the essential
danger surrounding the operation of a car moving vertically between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
floors in a shaft would long ago have been demanded by every form of
authority.</p>

<p>With other engineers, I was at one time opposed to the use of
such appliances on the ground of their uncertainty. But the growing
volume of fatalities directly attributable to the lack of such safeguards,
together with radical improvement in their construction, now demand
the opposite conclusion.</p>

<p>There has been particular objection in some large cities to the application
of devices for locking the gates, on the ground that the speed of
operation on rapid schedule service would be retarded and inconvenience
and overcrowding would result. In order to satisfy myself upon this
point, I made this year a series of comparative trials of elevators
equipped with one such appliance, the Clarke automatic safety devices,
and found that no such loss of time in service actually resulted. On the
contrary, a trial of the elevators in the Atlantic Mutual Insurance
Company’s Building, 49 Wall street, New York City, and in the Hotel
Imperial, showed that the operators made better time with the device
in service, as they were compelled to make more exact landings and thus
avoided much of the time frequently wasted in reversals of the car
movement.</p>

<p>Under the present circumstances, therefore, it seems that the proper
time has arrived for action in this respect, and that the example set by
the States of Pennsylvania and Rhode Island may be embodied in careful
legislative requirements in other States, which would, at some expense,
it is true, to private owners, safeguard the public from those peculiarly
present dangers which have taken such unnecessary toll of
human life and limb, in the ghastly entanglement between the gate or
doorway and the moving car, or the dreadful fall through the opened
gate.</p>

<p>It would be very desirable, if, in the investigation of this subject,
and the preparation of legislation to deal with it, competent technical
and legal ability were employed, as the subject is of a technical character.
Some of the legislation already in existence has been worded in
so ill-considered a manner, as to give the impression that it was phrased
in order to prevent the recovery of damages by injured persons.</p>

<p>The expression of your interest in this matter will tend to strengthen
the hands of those who are seeking at present, by the limited means
available, to enforce good methods of installation, proper safeguards and
proper operation. It will also aid our great manufacturers, who lead
the world in the design and construction of these truly American appliances,
in securing the proper surroundings and proper care they are
constantly urging for the appliances they construct, and will aid humanity
by averting some unnecessary wastage of the health and lives of
our fellow creatures.</p>

<p>Following Mr. Bolton’s paper he presented the following resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<h3><span class="hidden">Resolution, Mr. R. P. Bolton</span></h3>
<p>Whereas, The number of accidents and fatalities attending the operation
of elevators is increasing, many of which are of a preventable character;</p>

<p>Resolved, That the National Conservation Congress recommends to the Legislatures
of all States an official investigation of this subject, and the enactment
of such provisions as have been adopted by the States of Pennsylvania and
Rhode Island.</p>
</div>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—This is important, and if there is no objection it
will be handed to the Resolutions Committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Frederick Kelsey</span> (Orange, N. J.)—I would like to offer this
resolution:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Whereas, Under the laws of the District of Columbia and some of the States,
fictitious and fraudulent overcapitalization of corporations is permitted; and</p>

<p>Whereas, Under the operation of these promoter-made laws enormous and

creation and conduct of these creatures of the State back to the moorings of
common honesty.</p>
</div>

<p>I would like to say that, like most of the previous speakers, I have
given this subject very careful attention. I was chairman of a committee,
a civic and economic committee of our State, which committee
spent eight months in considering this subject, and I want to say that
you cannot appreciate the widespread loss, the injury, the injustice of
improper concentration of wealth that has been the direct outgrowth of
these laws in our own State and other States of the Union.</p>

<p>The Congress assembled at the Coliseum, at the State Fair Grounds,
Indianapolis, on the afternoon of October 3, 1912, and was called to
order by President White.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—This Conservation Congress was to have been addressed
today by the Governors of two of the States. I am very sorry
to announce that Governor Hadley, of Missouri, is unable to attend.</p>

<p>This Congress is greatly honored today. The city of Indianapolis
is greatly honored today. The State of Indiana is greatly honored, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span>
I personally am greatly honored. I feel honored in having the privilege
of presiding over a meeting at which our distinguished guest is to speak.</p>

<p>He who causes two blades of grass to grow where only one grew
before is a public benefactor. He who with one talent helps one child,
one boy, to rise to manhood and usefulness, is a great and useful citizen.
He who is fortunate enough to possess ten talents and who is an inspiration
to thousands of the youth of the land, who has planted in their
minds and in their hopes the desire to become great and useful in this
world, to become great and good, efficient citizens—he is the greatest
of all.</p>

<p>He is the Governor of a great State, and has inspired the citizens
of mature age to a better government for the people and led them on
to a greater field of usefulness. We feel perfectly safe in trusting him.
To whatever position duty may call, whatever fortune may trust him
with, the people will be safe under his guidance. (Applause.)</p>

<p>I feel unworthy to present to this audience one who has been the
leader in so many good works, one who has been a practical conservator
of human effort, but I take pleasure in introducing to you as the speaker
of this day one who has come here to get closer in touch with the Conservationists
of the United States, to gather from this audience an
inspiration as to the great force of Conservation which is to lead the
world—the Hon. Woodrow Wilson, Governor of New Jersey. (Great
applause.)</p>


<p class="center">ADDRESS BY THE HON. WOODROW WILSON, GOVERNOR OF NEW
JERSEY.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Address, Honorable Woodrow Wilson</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Chairman and Fellow-Citizens: It is with genuine pleasure that
I find myself in this place, facing a company of men and women who
are devoting themselves to so disinterested a cause as that to which this
Congress is consecrated.</p>

<p>Your chairman has stated in exactly the terms of my own thought,
the errand upon which I have come. It would seem presumption upon
my part to instruct this Congress, or to attempt to instruct it in the
means of Conservation. I have come here, as he has said, to share in
the inspiration of the occasion, to gather into my own thought an impression
of the men and women who are working for these great objects
in the United States. When I was on my way out here, and was thinking
of this occasion, I prepared my talk on the conservation of our natural
resources. When I arrived at the station, I was told to change the
subject, that was not what the Congress was, this year, devoting its particular
attention to, but to the conservation of the vital energy of the
people of the United States. I had thought that I would have to apologize
to you for wandering off before I had finished my address, into
that very topic, because it seems to me that the more broadly we view
the field of obligation, the more clearly it will appear to us that our duty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
is only done in respect to the laying of the foundation, when we have
conserved the natural resources of America, for those natural resources
are of no consequence unless there is a free and virile people to use them.</p>

<p>We are in the midst of a political campaign, and most of the audiences
that I have faced have been political audiences. I want to say
very frankly to you, that it is a comfort to me to face another kind,
because, in a campaign, we take politics, as it were, to the people, but
on this occasion the people of the United States are bringing to us the
great forces of their thought.</p>

<p>A congress like this means something more vital, in some aspects,
than any of the ordered efforts of political parties; for here are represented
the men and women from every quarter of the Union, come
together to speak that great volunteer voice of America, which is the
atmosphere of politics, which creates the environment of the public man,
which is the independent conscience of a great people asserting itself and
instructing those who serve it, what their lines of best service are.</p>

<p>All voluntary effort distinguishes a free people from a people that
is not free. An effort, an organization, that comes about whether the
politician wants it or not, is the kind of effort and organization which
shows that the people are ready to govern themselves and to assert their
own opinions, whether the men in the public eye now consent to be their
servants or not. (Applause.)</p>

<p>I have often made this boast about America, that, truly as we love
our own institutions, proud as we are of the political history of America,
if you could imagine yourself absolutely forgetting the documents upon
which our constitutional history rests, over night, in the morning, we
could make a new Constitution; we would not lose our self-possession,
we would not lose our long training in self-control; we would not lose our
instinct and genius for self-government. Strip us of one government,
and we would make a new America in which we would shine as much
as we did in the old. (Applause.) If that be not true, then it is not
America, for America consists in the independent and originative power
of the thought of the people. And so, when men and women from every
part of the country gather in a great congress like this, to speak, not of
matters of interest so much as of matters of duty, you realize in a gathering
like this the vitality of the heart as well as of the mind of America,
and men of every sort must give heed to the utterances of gatherings
of this kind.</p>

<p>I know that there are some persons who come to these gatherings
representing only themselves. I know that a gathering of men interested
in a special cause is a great magnet to the crank. I know that all sorts
of people, with special notions of their own, come sometimes to exploit
them; but, after all, we ought to be very tolerant even of them, because
some of the finest notions in the world have lived for a little while very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
lonely in the brain of a single man, or a single woman, and it is only
by the tolerance of preaching that they get their currency, and finally
get their imperial triumph by conquering the minds of the world, so that
it is these voluntary contributions of thought, these irresistible currents
of national life that are the most vital part of every people’s history.
That is the reason I say it is a comfort to face an audience that I am
not trying to persuade in regard to anything, but with which I am
trying to get in sympathy, in order to share the great force which they
represent.</p>

<p>It would be almost like assuring you that I was a thoughtful and
rational being to say that I am in profound sympathy with the whole
work of this great Congress, and that I am in particular sympathy, in
keenest sympathy with that part which affects the conservation of the
vital energy of the people of the United States. (Great applause.)</p>

<p>We have prided ourselves, ladies and gentlemen, upon our inventive
genius; we have prided ourselves upon the ability to devise machines that
can almost dispense with the intelligence of man. We have become a
great manufacturing people because of this genius, because of our ability
to draw together not only the tangible machinery of great enterprises
but also the intellectual machinery of great enterprises, and we have
been so proud of the mere multiplication of the resources of the Nation,
so proud of its wealth, so proud of the ingenious methods by which we
have increased its wealth, that we have been sometimes almost in danger
of forgetting what the real root of the whole matter is.</p>

<p>I say, without intending to indict anybody, that it has too often
happened that men have felt themselves obliged to dismiss superintendents
who overtaxed a delicate piece of machinery, who have not gone
further and felt obliged to dismiss a superintendent who overtaxed that
most delicate of all pieces of machinery, the human body and the human
brain. (Applause.)</p>

<p>If you drive your men and women too hard, your machinery will
presently have to go on the scrap heap. If you sap the vital energy
of your people, then there will be no energy in any part of the life you
live, or in any enterprise that you may undertake. The energy of your
people is not merely a physical energy. I am glad to say that the great
State of New Jersey, which I have the honor to represent, has been very
forward among her sister States in attempting to safeguard the lives
and the health of those who work in her factories, and in all the undertakings
which are in danger of impairing the health. I am glad to say
that our Legislature has been to a very considerable extent, though not
so far as it ought to be, thoughtful of the health of the children,
thoughtful of the strength of women, thoughtful of the men and women
together who have to breathe noxious gases, who are exposed to certain
kinds of dust bred in certain manufactories, which dust carries congestion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
and danger to the lungs and to the whole system—we have been
thoughtful of these things, but after all, we stand in exactly the same
relation to our bodies that the nation stands to her forests and her rivers
and her mines.</p>

<p>I have no use for my body unless I have a free and happy soul to be
a tenant of it. We have no happy use for this continent unless we
have a free and hopeful and energetic people to use it. I know that I
have sometimes spoken of how foreigners laugh at Americans because
they boast of the size of America, as if they had made it, and we are
twitted with a pride in something that we did not create. We did not
stretch all this great body of earth and pile it into beautiful mountains
and variegate it with forests from ocean to ocean, and they say, “Why
should you be so proud of what God created? You were not partners
in the creation?”</p>

<p>But it seems to me that it is perfectly open for us to reply, “Any
nation is as big as the thing that it accomplishes, and we have reason
to be proud of the size of America, because we have occupied and dominated
it.” (Applause.)</p>

<p>But we have come to a point where occupation and domination will
not suffice to win us credit with the nations of the earth or our own respect.
It was fine to have the cohesive and orderly power to plant commonwealths
from one side of this great continent to another. It was
pretty fine, and it strikes the imagination to remember the time when
the ring of the ax in the forest and the crack of the rifle meant not
merely the falling of a tree or the death of some living thing, but it
meant the voice of the vanguard of civilization, making spaces for homes,
destroying the wild life that would endanger human life, or destroying
the life which it was necessary to destroy in order to sustain human life;
and that the mere muscle, the mere quickness of eye, the mere indomitable
physical courage of those pioneers that crossed this continent ahead
of us, was evidence of the virility of the race, and was evidence also
of its capacity to rule, to rule and to make conquest of the things that it
needed to use. But now we have come to a point where everything has
to be justified by its spiritual consequences, and the difficult part of the
task is that which is immediately ahead of us.</p>

<p>Until the census of 1890, every census bureau could prepare maps
for us, on which the frontiers of settlement in America were drawn, and
until that time there had always been an interspace between the frontier
of the movement westward and the little strip of coast upon the Pacific,
which had been occupied, as it were, prematurely and out of order.</p>

<p>But, in 1890, it was impossible to draw a frontier in the United
States, it was impossible to show any places where the spaces had not,
at any rate, been sparsely filled, sparsely occupied by the populations
that lived under the flag of the Union. It was about that time, by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
way, or eight years later, that we were so eager for a frontier that we
established a new frontier in the Philippines, in order, as Mr. Kipling
would say, “to satisfy the feet of our young men.”</p>

<p>But the United States, ever since 1890, has been through with the
business of beginning and now has the enormously more difficult task
before it of finishing.</p>

<p>It is very easy, I am told, though I have never tried it, roughly to
sketch in a picture, that all the students in art schools can make the
rough sketch reasonably well, but they almost all, except those who have
passed a certain point, spoil the picture in the finishing. All the difficulties,
all the niceties of art, you have in the last touches, not in the
first, and all the difficulties and niceties of civilization lie in the last
touches, not in the first.</p>

<p>Anybody with courage and fortitude and resourcefulness can set up
a frontier, but we have discovered, to our cost, that not many of us can
set up a successful city government. (Applause.) Almost all the best
governed cities in the world are on the other side of the water; almost
all of the worst governed cities in the civilized world are in America.
And the thing that is most taxing our political genius is making a decent
finish, where we made such a distinguished beginning. We show it.
You can feel it under you as you traverse a city; you can feel it in the
pavements. They are provisional, most of them, or have not been laid
at all and in jolting in the streets that are not the main thoroughfares
of an American city, you feel the jolt of unfinished America. We have
not had time, or we have let the contract to the wrong man. (Great
applause.)</p>

<p>But, whatever be the cause, we have not completed the job in a way
that ought to be satisfactory to our pride. You know that we are waiting
for the development of an American literature, so I am told. Now,
literature can not be done with the flat hand; you can not write an immortal
sentence by taking a handful of words out of the dictionary and
scattering them over the page. They have to be wrought together with
the vital blood of the imagination, in order to speak to any other reader
except those of the day itself. And, as in all forms of art, whether literary,
or musical, or sculptural, there is this final test: can you finish
what you begin? I believe, therefore, that the problem of this Congress
is just this problem of putting the last touches on the human enterprise
which we undertook in America.</p>

<p>We did not undertake anything new in America in respect of our
industry. You will not find anything in the way of industry in America
which can not be matched elsewhere in the world. If the happiness
of our people and the welfare of our people does not exceed the happiness
and welfare of other people, then, as Americans, we have failed;
because we promised the world, not a new abundance of wealth, not an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
unprecedented scale of physical development, but a free and happy
people. (Applause.)</p>

<p>That is the final pledge which we shall have to redeem, and if we
do not redeem it, then we must admit an invalidity to the title deeds of
America.</p>

<p>America was set up and opened her doors, in order that all mankind
might come and find what it was to release their energies in a way that
would bring them comfort and happiness and peace of mind. And we
have to see to it that they get happiness and comfort and peace of mind;
and we have to lend the effort, not only of great volunteer associations
like this, but the efforts of our State governments and national government,
to this highest of all enterprises, to see that the people are taken
care of, not taken care of in the sense that those are taken care of who
can not take care of themselves, because the best way to teach a boy to
swim is to throw him into the water, and too much inflated apparatus
around him will only prevent his learning to swim, because the great
thing is not to go to the bottom and many of the devices by which we
now learn to swim make it unnecessary to swim, because you can stay on
top just the same, and I, for my part, do not believe that human vitality
is assisted by making it unnecessary for it to assert itself. On the contrary,
I believe that it is quickened only when it is put under such
stimulation as to feel the whip, whether of interest or of necessity, to
quicken it. But the last crux of the whole matter comes here: I am not
interested in exerting myself unless the exertion, when it is over, brings
me satisfaction.</p>

<p>If I have to work in such conditions that, every night, I fall into my
bed absolutely exhausted, and with the lamp of hope almost at its last
dying flicker, then I don’t care whether I get up in the morning or not;
and when I get up in the morning, I do not go blithely to my work. I
do not go to my work like a man who relishes the tasks of life. I go
there because I must go, or starve, and there is always the goad at my
stomach, the goad at my heart, because those dependent on me will suffer
if I do not go to my work and the only way I can go to my work with
satisfaction is to feel that, wherever I turn, I am dealing with my fellow-men,
with fellow-human beings. So that we must take the heartlessness
out of industry before we can put the heart into the men who are engaged
in the industry. (Applause.)</p>

<p>The employer has got to feel that he is dealing with flesh and blood
like his own and with his fellow-man, or else his employes will not be in
sympathy with him and will not be in sympathy with the work, and a
man who is not in sympathy with his work will not produce the things
that are worth using.</p>

<p>All the stories we tell to our children about work are told of such
men as Stradivarius, who lingered in the making of a violin as a lover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
would linger with his lady; who hated to take his fingers from the beloved
wood which was yielding its music to his magic touch. In all
poetry and song since, Stradivarius has been to us the type of the human
genius and heart that is put into the work that is done without attention
and zest.</p>

<p>We point to some of the exquisitely completed work of the stone
carvers of the Middle Ages, the little hidden pieces tucked away unseen
in the great cathedrals, where the work is just as loving in its detail and
completeness as it is upon the altar itself, and we say this is the efflorescence
of the human spirit expressed in work. The man knew that nobody,
except perhaps an occasional adventurer coming to repair that
cathedral, would ever see that work, but he wrought it for the sake of
his own heart and in the sight of God. And that, we instinctively accept
as the type of the spiritual side of work.</p>

<p>Now, imagine, ladies and gentlemen, imagine as merchants and manufacturers
and bankers, what would happen to the industrial supremacy
of the United States if all her workmen worked in that spirit. Would
there be goods anywhere in the world that could for one moment match
the goods made in America? Would not the American label be the label
of spiritual distinction? And how are you going to bring that about?
You are going to bring it about by such work as this Congress is interested
in and the work which will ensue, because the things which you
are discussing now are merely the passageways to things that are better.</p>

<p>Just so soon as you make it a matter of conscience with your legislatures
to see to it that human life is conserved wherever modern processes
touch it, just as soon as you make it the duty of society to release
the human spirit occasionally on playgrounds, to surround it with
beauty, to give it, even in the cities, a touch of nature, and the freedom
of the open sky, just as soon as you realize and have all of society realize
that play—enjoyment—is part of the building up of the human spirit,
and that the load must sometimes be lifted, or else it will be a breaking
load, just as soon as you realize that every time you touch the imagination
of your people and quicken their thought and encourage their hope
and spread abroad among them the sense of human fellowship and of
mutual helpfulness, you are elevating all the levels of the national life,
and then you will begin to see that your factories are doing better
work, because, sooner or later, this atmospheric influence is going to
get into every office in the United States, and men are going to see that
the best possible instruments that they can have are men whom they
regard as partners and fellow-beings. (Applause.)</p>

<p>I look upon a Congress like this as one of the indispensable instruments
of the public life. Law, ladies and gentlemen, does not run
before the thought of society and draw that thought after it. Law is
nothing else but the embodiment of the thought of society, and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
I see great bodies of men and women like this, running ahead of the
law, and beckoning it on to fair enterprises of every sort, I know that
I see the rising tide which is going to bring these things in inevitably.
I know that I see law in the making; I know that I see the future forming
its lines before my eyes, and that, presently, when we come to an
agreement, and wherever we come to substantial agreement, we shall
have the things that we desire. So that, for a man in public life, an
assemblage like this is the food of his thought, if he lend his thought to
what his fellow-countrymen are desiring and planning; and all the zest
of politics lies, not in holding things where they are, but in carrying
them forward along the lines of promise, to the place where they ought
to be. (Applause.)</p>

<p>You are our consciences, you are our mentors, you are our schoolmasters.
The men in public life have only twenty-four hours in their
day and they generally spend eight of the twenty-four in sleeping—I
must admit generally to spending nine—and in what remains they cannot
comprehend the interests of a great nation. No man that I ever met,
no group of men that I ever met, could sum up in their own thought the
interests of a varied nation. Therefore, they are absolutely dependent
upon suggestions coming from every fertile quarter, into their consciousness.
They are subject, or they ought to be subject, daily, to instruction.
A gentleman was quoting to me today a very fine remark
of Prince Bismarck’s. He was taxed with inconsistency, with holding
an opinion today that he had not held yesterday. He said he would be
ashamed of himself if he did not hold himself at liberty, whenever he
learned a new fact, to readjust his opinions. Why, that is what learning
is for. Ought any man to be ashamed of having accepted the Darwinian
theory, because he did not hold it before Darwin demonstrated it?
Ought any man to be ashamed of having given up the Copernican idea
of the universe? Ought any man to be obliged to apologize for having
yielded to the facts? If he does not he will sooner or later be very
sorry, because the facts are our masters, and if we do not yield to them,
we will presently be their slaves. I suppose if I chose to assert the full
consistency of my independence I would say that I was at liberty to
jump from the top of this building, but just as soon as I reached the
ground nature would have said to me, “You fool, didn’t you ever hear
of the law of gravitation? Didn’t you hear of any of the things that
would happen to you if you jumped off a building of this height? Suppose
you spend a considerable period in a hospital thinking it over,”
and it would be very impressively borne in upon me what the penalties
of ignorance of the law of gravitation are. Now, it is going to be very
impressively borne in upon the public men of this country if they ignore
them what the laws of human life are. As Dr. Holmes used to say,
“The truth is no invalid. You need not be afraid; no matter how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
roughly you treat her, she will survive, and if you treat her too roughly
there will be a certain reaction in your own situation which will be the
severest penalty you could carry.”</p>

<p>I come, therefore, to Indianapolis today to put my mind at your
service, merely to express an attitude, merely to confess a faith, merely
to declare the deep interest which must underlie all human effort, for,
when the last thing is said about human effort, ladies and gentlemen,
it lies in human sympathy. Unless the hearts of men are bound together
the policies of men will fail, because the only thing that makes
classes in a great nation is that they do not understand that their interests
are identical. (Applause.)</p>

<p>The only thing that embarrasses public action is that certain men
seek advantages which they can gain only at the expense of the rest of
the country, and when they have gained them those very advantages
prove the heaviest weight they have to carry, because they are then
responsible for all that happens to those upon whom they have imposed
and to those from whom they have subtracted what was their right.</p>

<p>So that the deepest task of all politics is to understand one another;
the deepest task of all politics is to understand everybody, and I do not
see how everybody is going to be understood unless everybody speaks
up, and the more independent spokesmen there are the more vocal the
Nation is, the more certain we shall be to work out in peace and finally
in pride the great tasks which lie ahead of us. (Great and prolonged
applause.)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="NINTH_SESSION"><a href="#contents"><em>NINTH SESSION.</em></a></h2>
</div>


<p>The Congress reconvened at 8 o’clock p. m., in the Palm Room of the
Claypool Hotel, and was called to order by President White.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—This is the evening session of the National Conservation
Congress. I foresaw what was coming a long time ago when
we began to prepare a program. I knew there would be a large number
of ladies here, because they were getting very enthusiastic. I knew they
would want section meetings for themselves to talk over matters of vital
interest and plan how they were going to work for Conservation in all
its departments, vital, social and political.</p>

<p>I felt that I was not capable and I did not know of any man who was
capable of presiding over a large number of women, who sweetly and
persistently know what they want and are bound to get it. (Laughter
and applause.)</p>

<p>I was invited by the lady who is going to take charge of this meeting
to attend the convention of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs at
San Francisco, and right there I decided that Mrs. Moore should preside
at this Congress at some one of its meetings, and I politely told her so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
at that time. I did it in justification of her rare ability displayed upon
that occasion, and, selfishly, because I knew I was too timid to rule on
points of order where there were so many women. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>I take pleasure in introducing Mrs. Philip N. Moore, of St. Louis,
former President of the General Federation of Women’s Clubs, and a
member of the Executive Committee of this Congress. She needs no
introduction, as you all have met her many times. I now turn the meeting
over to her good graces and good will.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mrs. Philip N. Moore</span></h3>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: During the
year that I have had the pleasure of working with the presiding officer
of this Congress, it has been his gracious courtesy during the whole time
to the woman who was on the Executive Committee that has induced me
to accept the position he has given me tonight.</p>

<p>Many of you will remember that four years ago, when the Governors
were called to the White House in Washington, to discuss the natural
resources of our country, the only woman’s organization that was represented
at that time was the General Federation of Women’s Clubs,
through its President. From that time to this, the Conservation Congress
has recognized this organization as being very much interested in
the conservation of the natural resources of the country as well as in the
conservation of human life through its public health department, through
its industrial and social conditions and through its home economics, four
of the strongest departments of the General Federation. I am, therefore,
very proud tonight to accept the courtesy of the presiding officer of
the Congress.</p>

<p>While we are waiting slightly for the first speaker of the evening, I
have asked the next one upon the program to take her place. I am
sure it will be just as much of a pleasure to you, and I am sure it
will be a pleasure to her, to take the earlier place upon the program.</p>

<p>We are all very much interested, as men and women, as fathers and
mothers, in the Children’s Bureau which has been created this past year,
and we were very much interested in the possibility of a woman being
made chief of that bureau. There never was a question in our minds
but that it should be the very best person that could be found, whether
man or woman. But the fact that there was a woman who by education,
training and experience was fitted to take this place has been a pleasure
to all who are interested in that special development. The fact that she
has looked into the life of children from birth through childhood, with
work and play and home and school as they have applied to the life of
the child, will be of the greatest benefit to us all through these future
years.</p>

<p>I am very glad to introduce to this representative audience of the
Congress, Miss Julia Clifford Lathrop, who is Chief of the Children’s
Bureau of the United States Department of Commerce and Labor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, Miss Julia Clifford Lathrop</span></h3>
<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Lathrop</span>—Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I need
not explain to a Congress interested in Conservation why the representative
of this new Bureau should be here and should wish to speak about
the Bureau itself.</p>

<p>When I was first honored with this appointment it was suggested that
the Bureau should be staffed with women alone, and I was asked what I
thought about it. I said I should be very much embarrassed; that I had
never known any children who had not two parents, and that I felt that
if there had been intended a division of that sort the Lord would have
communicated it long ago. I thought it would be presumptious for me
to begin, so the Children’s Bureau has on its staff both men and women
and, perhaps, I may as well begin by saying something about that staff,
and about the organization of this new Bureau. And, first of all, perhaps
I may forestall a criticism which is likely to come before very long
that we are rather dilatory and are not accomplishing very much, by
reminding you that the Bureau did not go into operation last April, when
the President approved the bill, but only on the 23d of August, when
the appropriation became available, so that really the Bureau is just
forty-one days old. It has a staff of fifteen persons, and it has to spend
for this first year a sum aggregating about thirty thousand dollars. Its
province, as the law says, is to inquire into and report upon all matters
pertaining to the welfare of children and child life. You can see for
yourselves whether that is a big job and whether the army really seems
adequate for immediate performance of the contract.</p>

<p>It is, of course, enormously important that a Bureau of this kind,
undertaking a sort of work which, after all, is in some respects new,
should be composed of people who have very much at heart the welfare of
children; who have, even as much as that, the scientific training and
wisdom which is necessary if we are to make an appeal to people’s emotions
and sentiment. So the staff of the Bureau is composed of people
who have been selected from various departments of the Federal Civil
Service as having, particularly, acquirements in science, as statisticians,
and in other respects particularly fitted, as we believe and as my superiors
believe, to do the work of this growing Bureau.</p>

<p>The Bureau has this great general object. Now, it is a question how
to take hold of this great task, where to begin, but the law itself does
give some hint—it enumerates certain objects which we shall discuss in
detail as time goes on.</p>

<p>The first of these is infant mortality and the birth rate, and after
that follows various subjects, such as juvenile courts, or the care of
children in regard to diseases and accidents which may befall them, the
regulation of their labor, legislation affecting children and all matters
pertaining to their welfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span></p>

<p>It is all very well for those of us who are doing all sorts of volunteer
work, as most of us are, to begin on the problem of helping people at any
point where we can take hold. We do not have to know any great
fundamental facts; to know that babies need care, and that children
ought not to go to work when they are too young, to know that children
need to go to school, need to be healthy, need to be happy, and that they
need recreation just as much as they do education and that the two are
part of the one same great sort of development—all these things we
have a right to begin on anywhere we can. But when the Federal Government
takes hold, I think it somehow promises a sort of basis to all
the rest of us, and it seems as if it were its business to see where there
was the most fundamental point to begin its work. When we come to
look at the question of dealing with children, we are constantly faced by
the fact that we do not know how many children there are; we do not
know how many children are born and die in this country. We do
know once in ten years how many children exist at a particular moment,
and by that decennial information we know that the Bureau has to deal
with about thirty-six per cent. of the total population of this country
directly, that between thirty-five and forty per cent. of the population
of this country is under sixteen years of age, which seems to be the age
of the end of childhood, just by common acceptation; at least, at that
age in many of our States children are permitted to become independent
workmen. So you see we have a very large number of children with
whom we have the right to deal directly, and, as I tried to show a
moment ago, we think we have a right to deal indirectly with all their
parents. We think the whole country is a good deal our province in
prospect, but we cannot be satisfied with this decennial knowledge of
how many people there are in this country. What we want is a great,
democratic continuing public edition of “Who’s Who in America.” We
want to know day by day the advent of every citizen into this country.
We want, in fact, in a phrase which is not particularly exciting, “birth
registration.”</p>

<p>First of all, we want it because we want to know, and we want to
know for various reasons, which I think do not occur to most of us every
day. In the first place, we want to know because, unfortunately, a great
many babies come into this world under circumstances which do not
give them the best chance in the world. If the advent of a little child
could be at once communicated to doctors and nurses where doctors and
nurses are not taken for granted, it would be possible to prevent the risk
of that blindness which sometimes overtakes newly-born children; it is
possible to establish the health of the mother and child together, so that
it may have the best chance in the world; and you all know how throughout
this country, even in our remoter counties, there is coming to be a
great and splendid health service. I think we cannot be too delighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
with what the Red Cross Society, with what many similar societies are
doing in the way of rural nursing. I think if Florence Nightingale
could look out over America now, she would think we are beginning to
realize her noble words about health and nurses.</p>

<p>Now, those are perhaps the most important reasons why we want to
know the advent of every child, so that we can help that little child, and
help his mother and keep her alive, because it is a very terrible thing
that out of all the children who are born into this country a very large
number—two hundred thousand, some people say, and three hundred
thousand, some people say—die before they are twelve months old, and
more, a third of them die before they have been in the world a month.
I want us to consider this for a minute, not as an economic problem, but
what it means in the old fashioned terms of human suffering, the agony
and loss of family happiness and joy, that two hundred thousand little
babies should die and leave the hearths to which they come every single
year of the world in this country. And when we think that already,
doctors tell us, we know enough so that that waste is very largely the
fault of our carelessness and selfishness and greed, it makes us blush to
think we are not all working hard to save the lives of these children.</p>

<p>Now, there are great efforts already undertaken to save the lives of
these little babies, in which many of you are already engaged, and we
may well hope that such societies as this Conservation Congress and the
Congress for the Prevention of Infant Mortality will before the next
decennial census occurs have made a great difference in the number of
children who are born, only to die.</p>

<p>But, suppose that a child lives, is there any real sense in his having a
birth certificate, or is that just some abstract notion of the statisticians,
who get all the certificates and have punching machines and a great many
mechanical contrivances for numbering and making computations out of
figures? I think you will be surprised to find how much human connection
it has.</p>

<p>In the first place, as to this very Bureau for which I am venturing to
speak, we are told to find out about the diseases of children and about
the birth rate of children. How can we know about the birth rate unless
we know how many children are born and die? In Washington, there
was set up a wonderful placard on the wall to show the birth rate in that
city, and there were columns of red and green and other colors, and you
just knew, humanly speaking, that the birth rate was fluctuating that
way, and you talked with somebody and you discovered that this birth
rate was fluctuating as one set of gentlemen or another was electing the
health officer.</p>

<p>So now we want to have some authoritative way of truly finding out
how many children come into the world in order to know what the birth
rate is, in order to know how to study the diseases of children, and then,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span>
when children grow a little older, we want to have a public record of
their births so that we may know when they are entitled to go into the
schools to begin on that system of care and culture for which the public
schools stand, and then beyond that, when they are older and the time
comes for their advent into the army of work to which we hope we all
belong, then we want to know that those who are less favored are not
hurried into that army unduly. How much it would simplify the problem
if we had not to trust to all sorts of chance ways of proving a child’s
birth and if we had a public record of it.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought that we are the only great nation which does
not know how many children are born into it, and which does not do its
children the dignity of putting their names down in a public record?
All Europe has a public registry, and why? Because it has a standing
army and wants the names of its boys for conscription. Now, in a country
of peace, aren’t we to have any victories for peace? Are not we to
recognize a child as having any dignity to be a peaceable citizen and not
either a target for a gun, or the man behind the gun?</p>

<p>I think you will, perhaps, be interested if I venture to tell a story of
a neighborhood in which I have lived long, an illustration of how a
birth certificate is a good thing. A little while ago, a family came over
to Hull House for some help. They were awfully poor. The oldest girl,
who was at that time the breadwinner of that family, was out of work on
account of the garment workers’ strike. There were eight children.
They had come over at the time of the earthquake in Messina. The
father had been entombed and his mind had almost succumbed to the
fearful experience. He was always thinking the walls were coming on
him and he was not in a very good frame of mind to be a successful
breadwinner. So they got into difficulties and asked the Charities Board
to help them. There was another younger girl and they thought they
had better get a work certificate for Giovanna, but the truant officer said
she looked too young and couldn’t have it, and she was sent back to
school. And then they got a little more desperate and they tried again
to have poor little Giovanna go to work. The Charities Board, who were
helping the case, thought they had a right to dictate a little as to how
they should help, and they just wrote to the City Hall in Messina, and
the City Hall in Messina sent back a very prompt letter showing how
old the children were, and showing that the daughter who had been at
work for two years was really about fourteen years old and had been
working that time illegally, had been cheated of two years of school,
where she might have learned good English and learned American housekeeping
and had a better chance to earn more money the next two years.
The other little girl was still younger. So the people in Hull House and
the people in the Associated Charities and the factory inspector made a
veritable cordon around this helpless family and demanded they be sent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
back to school. The oldest girl went back very unwillingly. She said
indignantly, “Me go back to school, me big enough to be married.” She
was very hurt and humiliated. I am not sure we did right about it.
Giovanna was confiscated and sent back to school for two years. This
family did not have a fair chance over here just because the factory
inspector and school authorities, not having any birth reports over here
for children, followed the usual system of guessing and did not think to
take advantage of what Messina, notwithstanding the earthquake, had to
offer from her very responsible records.</p>

<p>Has it ever occurred to you that to very many of our foreign residents
a birth certificate for a child would be an absolute asset?</p>

<p>In Chicago is a very prosperous and highly respected man. He came
from Germany when he was a baby of four years, with the family. His
father was never naturalized and the man himself never was challenged
in his right to vote. He grew up and attended our public schools, and
all that. He accumulated a fortune and went back, as many people do,
I suppose rather proud, to see the old country and friends who remained
there and with whom he had kept in constant communication, a prosperous
and splendid example of what America could do for a man. He
had been in Berlin for about two hours when the police were on his track
merely because he was a German citizen and must serve in the army.
He telephoned to a lawyer friend and asked him what could happen. He
said, “There is just one thing that can happen, and that is that you get
out of town.” So, two hours after he arrived at Berlin on this triumphal
journey, he left very actively, and he is said never to have heaved
a sigh of such joyful relief as when the crossed the boundary into France.
That is an example of people really knowing where they were born and
being able to prove it.</p>

<p>I suppose the reason we have not been more eager about our birth rate
is because we have not thought anything about it. We think a great
deal about writing the baby’s name in the family Bible and christening it
in the church we attend, but somehow we have forgotten this larger,
more fundamental thing. The advent, of every citizen of this country
ought to be on the books of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>There is a very good story, which belongs to your own Dr. Hurty.
I do not know whether you all know it, or whether I dare tell it, but I
will presume that this audience is largely made up of visitors, and steal
his story. In this State, Dr. Hurty is authority for saying there was a
farmer who had a ne’er-do-well son and a granddaughter, and when the
farmer came to die he wished to leave the farm to the granddaughter,
but he left the use of it to the son until the granddaughter should arrive
at the age of twenty-one. When the girl, as she thought, was twenty-one,
she claimed her inheritance, but the other side said she was only
nineteen. She went to the Bible, where her name was written down, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
the leaf was torn out, and the court was very much perplexed. It came
to be a serious legal question, and finally a neighbor recollected that the
grandfather had had a very remarkable calf born on the same day with
this little girl, and he said he knew the farm books kept by the grandfather
would record this pedigree. So the farm books were looked up
and the birth of the calf was discovered and the birth of the girl was
established. (Laughter.) You all remember how George Bernard Shaw
warns us against placing confidence in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deus ex machina</i>. He says
you cannot presume on things being some miraculous way you would
like them to be, and so we cannot presume on grandfathers always keeping
herds of cattle. (Applause.)</p>

<p>I am perfectly sure, as I have said before, as I had the honor of
saying over at San Francisco before the General Federation of Women’s
Clubs, that if the women of America wanted birth registration they
would get it in a twelvemonth. Now, it sounds so very remote from
putting down the baby’s name in the book.</p>

<p>In the State of Indiana you have a very good law, Dr. Hurty tells
me, and all that is necessary is for the women of Indiana to say that
they want the names when their children are born recorded in the public
records of Indiana. In 1910, when the last census was taken, all that
we know about the births in this country was what we learned from
eight States, the New England States, Pennsylvania and Michigan. Not
your State, or mine, Illinois, was deemed worthy to be considered at all.
So far as the general government was concerned, for anything it knew,
nobody had been born in either of these States in ten years. In the
next census year, I hope very much in a great many States in this country,
perhaps in all the States in this country, we shall be able to be recognized
by the general government as having been born and as having
been born very accurately, so that we will be worthy to be counted, as
much so as if we lived in Boston and Massachusetts, which, they are
always telling us, are the most accurate State and city.</p>

<p>Of course, the Bureau cares for a great many things besides the registration
of births, but I hope I have made it plain that we should ask
that we be allowed to get a method of acquiring steady, constant and
reliable means of legal proof as to the children who enter this Nation,
because it is the dignified basis for a governmental Bureau, which I
believe is destined to grow to proportions which none of us can measure,
which shall continue long after all of us are gone. No other bureau in
the world makes so tremendous an appeal to the emotions and sentiment—a
children’s bureau, a bureau to concern itself with the life and
happiness of the children of a great nation, and the more appealing it is,
the more must it be founded upon facts which will bear the very closest
scientific scrutiny. What the Bureau will be doing years from now I
do not know. I know what it must do now. The law is very distinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
about some of the things it must do, and by implication many of the
things it cannot do. It is a bureau to gather information and to publish
it as the secretary of the department under which it exists may direct.
It can publish in any way which the secretary deems best. There are a
great many different ways of publishing facts. We are learning to publish
facts through the sort of thing you have in the State House here
and other exhibits, through the appeal to the eye. In this way thousands
of those who cannot study very carefully or cannot read a table
to save their lives may understand, and I hope it is with some of the
simpler methods of popularizing things that this Bureau may begin to
make itself useful.</p>

<p>The Bureau, although it is a different type from all the other work of
the government in a certain sense, after all, is not so isolated as we
might think. There is a Bureau of Labor, which has studied much the
labor of women and children. There is the Census Bureau, of which I
have spoken. There is the Bureau of Immigration and of Education,
and the Bureau in the Department of Agriculture, which has concerned
itself very much in the South with those very interesting and productive
efforts for better farming, which have begun their activities by stimulating
tomato-canning among the girls. All of these things, part of them
purely educational, part of them a matter of direct work, are things
which we shall not do over again, from which we hope to learn very
much.</p>

<p>There have been a good many anxieties about this Bureau, many
people have thought it was a mistake. Some people have said, “Ah,
well, you are going to center everything about children away off there
in Washington where there will be a government with a lot of very comfortable
clerks sitting about in offices and writing down figures about
children instead of doing things for children and you will palsy local
effort.” If the Bureau does that it is a failure. What the Bureau
must do is to stimulate and help local effort. It must gather facts and
try to present them so convincingly and simply that they will be useful
and stimulate many to activity.</p>

<p>Then there has been a great dread lest the Children’s Bureau might
interfere with parental rights, lest the Bureau might seem to override the
dignity and privacy of homes. I do not believe the Bureau will ever do
that, because I know that the people who care most about the Bureau
are people who realize that the welfare of the child is measured by the
welfare and the wisdom of its parents, and that the way to help the child
is not to take him out of the family, but keep him in it and help the
parents to help him. And the Bureau will do its work with a fine respect
for parenthood. And perhaps I cannot better close, since this is a
woman’s meeting, and we may well be generous to the gentlemen scattered
here and there, by a story of a man, a father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span></p>

<p>Not long ago I went to a meeting in Chicago, at which there were
many delegates from the foreign colonies in that city. It was a representative
meeting standing for about one hundred thousand residents of
that foreign town. It was really a meeting of protest against threatened
restrictions which many of us thought very ill-advised and cruel,
which were to be applied to immigration. A man rose who belonged to a
foreign colony which we are accustomed to regard as especially dull and
illiterate, and he told very simply how that colony had come from a
people who had been oppressed, the study of its language had been forbidden,
reading and writing had been forbidden, and in a way, a certain
illiteracy and dulness had been forced upon them; and he told so simply
with what ardor they came here where there was freedom, where there
were schools. I shall never forget how simply he said, “I am a father,
and, like every father, I want my child to go higher than me.”</p>

<p>That was the simple but overwhelmingly eloquent expression of a
man whose English was very broken, but who, after all, spoke exactly the
great impulse which has controlled all of us since the beginning of that
wonderful seventeenth century when parents began to come over here.
And, as I heard him speak, I thought that whether it was those who came
in the cabin of the Mayflower, or those who sank in the steerage of the
Titanic, they were all moved by that same mighty impulse, that the next
generation should have a better chance than they had.</p>

<p>Now, this Bureau must move forward if it is to be useful in the
same spirit in which families move forward, in which the race moves
forward, to give the next generation a better chance than this has had.
I thank you. (Applause.)</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>—Those of us who heard Dr. Wiley, the other evening,
give his impressions, may be interested in giving to Miss Lathrop
another fact which will prove the value of birth registry. Dr. Wiley
said that no one across the water could marry unless he could prove that
he had been born. It would be impossible for many to marry in this
country, if that were the case here.</p>

<p>We have always admired the way the Daughters of the American
Revolution have taken the history of our country, have looked up the old
stamping grounds and marked them, and have taught the children in
schools the traditions of the country, to honor the makers of our country
and to make them good American citizens. But we are really more
pleased that the Daughters of the American Revolution have recently
taken up more modern things, and that they are preserving the resources
of the children. The speaker has been very much interested in modern
life, in community life for the rural life of our country.</p>

<p>As a loyal Daughter, I have great pleasure in introducing to you
Mrs. Matthew T. Scott, of Washington, D. C., President General of the
Daughters of the American Revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span></p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, Mrs. Matthew T. Scott</span></h3>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Scott</span>—Madam President, Members of the Fourth Conservation
Congress: Among the many opportunities for service, which today are
open to women in this country, there are three to which I wish to call
attention for a few moments this evening. The first is that of the
unrealized possibilities of the home life of the nation. If we only were
endowed with a larger share of that priceless attribute—the constructive
imagination—we should be able to see the untold resources which still lie
latent, waiting only to be discovered, developed and enjoyed in the mysterious
precincts of that laboratory of the soul—that forging-room of
character, that fountain-head of those subtle forces which add temper
and edge and distinction to our ordinary human attributes—that civic
and social Holy of Holies—which we call Home.</p>

<p>And let us remember that the sources of our country’s permanent
prosperity and glory lie not in the form of our government, in the wisdom
of its administration, nor even in its written laws and constitution,
but deep in the intellectual and moral life of society, and potentially in
those nameless influences, radiating from the women who give its halcyon
charm to hearthstone and library and to all the intimacies and inspirations
of the home. For, after all, it is the home—the sanctuary to which
we women must hark back—the home, with its <em>sanctity</em>, which is the
palladium, the corner-stone, the key to the arch, of all that is most precious
in the life and destiny of America.</p>

<p>Again, let us never forget, that to us women—the home-makers of our
land—as never before in the world’s history, is entrusted the healthy
development of the social and moral fabric of society in our country, in
the innumerable and intricate complications of this Twentieth Century
civilization. A distinguished educator has recently said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“At the present time the world is awakening to the teachings of the
old prophets. Now, as then, the morals and ethics of a nation are just
what the wives and mothers, the home-makers of the land, make them.”</p>
</div>

<p>Again, the home is also the place where the future citizens of this
nation are to be trained. The place that fosters patriotism, obedience
and love, reverence for authority, the finest elements of character. Some
day the present generation will have to hand this country over to the
sons and daughters who are being trained by fathers and mothers of
today to administer the affairs of the home, in preparation for the larger
field and wider duties of government. It is well for youth to learn that
honest toil is never hopeless or degrading. It is well for youth to be at
one with Nature and to learn of her; to know and feel the joy there is in
bountiful, glorious Nature; to be familiar with her song—the ripple of
the river on its stones, the murmur of trees, the rhythm of the sap that
rises in them, the thunder in the hills, the stars shining in perennial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
beauty, the song of the thrush, and the carol of the lark; to watch the
sun in its course and learn the dim paths of the forest.</p>

<p class="center">“It is the song of infinite harmonies.”</p>

<p>The man, woman or child of vision responds—perhaps, all unconsciously
and inarticulately—but responds like a vibrating chord to the
note of these melodies, that should be part of the charm of the home-life
of the farm.</p>

<p>There can be no disputing the fact that a goodly number of American
women are wonderfully successful home-makers. But at the same time,
it must be admitted, that a large number of our household mistresses
must plead guilty to the charges of extravagance—technical ignorance of
household economy—and a considerable degree of all-round inefficiency,
both as housekeepers and as home-makers, for the terms are not
synonymous.</p>

<p>It is a commonplace among sociologists that in most well-to-do
American homes enough is wasted in the kitchen alone to keep a French
family in comfort. We are also wasteful of light and heat, and, above
all, of our time and energy. Our country is in dire need of a woman
who will do for the home what a distinguished inventor and public benefactor
of Philadelphia has done for the factory—that is, introduce an
“efficiency” system, which will do away with our present waste of both
money and time, and increase the quantity and quality of the actual
output—not only of creature comforts, but also of artistic attractiveness;
and of that indefinable atmosphere of peace and restfulness, which, of
all the by-products of home life, is certainly the pearl of greatest price.
The time will surely come when both mistress and maid will prepare
for their life’s work—as home-makers—with the same care and enthusiasm
that men now put into the work of perfecting themselves in their
various trades and professions. Home-making, like piano-playing, is an
art—to succeed in which requires something more than temperament.
Until the technique has been properly mastered, temperament has little
opportunity to manifest itself to advantage.</p>

<p>A generation ago home-making and farming were occupations that
anyone with a mediocre intelligence and a reasonable degree of industry
was considered sufficiently equipped for. But today these two avocations
occupy a secure and increasingly important place among the
learned professions.</p>

<p>Agriculture, “dignified by the ages, as old well-nigh as the green earth
itself,” has become a scientific profession alluring to men and women
of brains and culture, who quickly become enthralled by its ever-expanding
and fascinating possibilities. In every State in the Union we have
magnificent agricultural colleges and schools of domestic science, in which
are being prepared for their respective careers thousands of prospective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
farmers and thousands of prospective housewives. Moreover, several
bills have been pending before Congress which provide for the widest
possible dissemination of instruction in agriculture and domestic science
(including the pure food problem) among the rural population of every
county in this Nation.</p>

<p>This is a glorious work. The proposed instruction in agriculture is
something which, as a farmer, I am particularly enthusiastic about. Yet
I feel that quite as important as this will be the educational facilities in
the household arts and in the highest home-making ideals, which are to
be placed within reach of every housekeeper and every prospective housekeeper
in this land. Just as agriculture is the basis of all our material
prosperity and power, so the home is the perennial and sacred source
from which emanate those potent, ennobling and refining influences,
which slowly and silently have lifted man out of past savagery, and will
yet, we trust, lift us out of our present state of semi-civilization—with
its class war, political and business corruption and industrial brutality—on
to higher and even higher stages of moral, intellectual and social development.</p>

<p>This is my idea of the relatedness of Conservation to the home. Is
there any question that this is truly Conservation—its essence—in the
minds of any member of this convention?</p>

<p>The second realm of opportunity which I want to point out to you is
that which spreads out before us in a bewildering splendor of promise, in
connection with the schooling of the young, as related to the home. We
are all aware that the large majority of our common and high school
teachers are women. In many of our States women vote for members of
the School Board, and if a majority of them really wanted this right,
there is no doubt that they would secure it everywhere. In this event
it would be a comparatively easy matter for them to formulate and carry
through policies of their own. Thus from the cradle to the university the
education of the children is potentially in the hands of the women of this
country.</p>

<p>This is a power which the priests of various religions frequently have
endeavored to obtain on the grounds that if they were allowed to control
and dominate the child’s mind during its formative period, their influence
upon its after-life would be dominant and enduring. I wonder if
we realize what almost unlimited power over future generations is thus
entrusted to our hands. Are we, as women and mothers, exercising that
power with an adequate sense of the responsibility which it places upon
our shoulders?</p>

<p>There are now thousands and hundreds of thousands of our sex who
are pining for something to do, which they can feel is entirely and
splendidly worth their while. How fortunate it is, that here, already at
hand, is a task which Nature, and “Man, the tyrant,” are agreed is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
peculiarly adapted to our particular tastes and talents. But what are
we doing about it? Little as a sex, I fear, that is either significant or
creditable. When not merely in a few isolated cases, but as a class, the
women of America decide what they want in the way of education for
their children, if they want it badly enough, there is no earthly power
which can stand between them and their splendid ideal goal.</p>

<p>But this means work, persistent, intelligent work. First of all, in
the matter of self-education, and, secondly, in that of carrying on an
aggressive campaign for the education of our own sex, and, if possible,
of the other sex as well.</p>

<p>I am beginning to get deeply concerned, not about the lack of adequate
opportunities for service on the part of women, but about our
failure, so far, to measure up to the incomparable opportunities which
are already ours. If there is any subject in which we, as women, ought
to be intensely and intelligently interested, it is in this subject of education—not
in the academic sense alone, but in the broader view of character-building—upon
a proper understanding and handling of which
depends the very future of civilization.</p>

<p>This, I take it, is truly Conservation work and when thoroughly
grasped, will as truly mark milestones of progress in our lifetime, as
those we may leave behind in material form.</p>

<p>The third of these brilliant avenues of possible social service, which
open before us in beautiful vistas of alluring opportunity, is one which
is involved in the purchasing power of women. As a general thing, men
are the wage-earners and women are the wage-spenders for the home.
Nearly all of the household expenditures of the family are made by the
wives and mothers of the race. It is a sad commentary upon our business
ability, and our rudimentary sense of social solidarity, that so few
of us have any realizing sense of the potential power over the business
and industrial world, which is inherent in this our position as buyer, or
spender, for the family.</p>

<p>I call your attention to the fact that if the women of America would
pool their purchasing power, and, resisting all the blandishments of the
“bargain counter” and the “sale”—based on sweat-shop labor—would
demand pure goods, made and sold under sanitary and salutary conditions—more
could be accomplished for the moral and material uplift of
the factory-worker and the saleswoman than by the enactment of a
volume of restrictive statute, the breaking of which we thoughtlessly
connive at, and practically become a party to, in our mad scramble for
cheapness at any cost of human degradation and wreckage.</p>

<p>A superb organization, known as the “Consumers’ League,” has come
into being, for the express purpose of enabling men, as well as women,
to utilize their purchasing power in the great work of raising the standards
of the business and industrial worlds, both as to the purity of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
product offered to the public and the fairness of the treatment accorded
to employes.</p>

<p>Of all the splendid “movements” and “causes” which today invite
our co-operation and support, this is one of many, which seem to me to
fall naturally within our province, as wives, mothers and home-makers.
It is the principle underlying this great crusade of the “Consumers’
League” and like organizations which appeal to us. As a matter of fact,
this is a work for the betterment of women in the business and industrial
worlds, and as a consequence improvement in the home, which we
women cannot avoid doing, without definitely and publicly shirking our
heavy economic and moral responsibilities, as family purveyors and
budget makers. Or, in other words, as domestic chancellors of the
exchequer.</p>

<p>Far be it from me to say that the members of our sex may not some
day decide to undertake, in addition to their other duties, the heavy responsibilities
of the voter and political worker. Perhaps it may transpire,
that upon our planet the true super-man is woman, and that she is
entirely capable of doing the man’s work as well as her own. But, in
the interim, until this fact has been satisfactorily demonstrated, let us
devote ourselves whole-heartedly to what is more particularly woman’s
work; to those delicate and difficult tasks for which man’s clumsy fingers
and prosaic processes of reasoning are unfitted and wholly inadequate.
And, above all, let us be quite sure that we do our especial work—at
least as well as he does his—before we insist upon taking a hand in his
activities and improving upon his methods of performing his highly useful,
if somewhat less exalted, functions.</p>

<p>It may seem in these lines of work—somewhat unique—and hitherto
undefined as belonging to the realm of Conservation, that I am departing
a long way from the usual addresses on that subject. But I ask your
careful consideration of this subconscious knowledge of every woman’s
breast, that at least every issue and question I have referred to has its
foundation, in the broadest and deepest sense, in the life and action
which center in the home.</p>

<p>In the ways which I have so hastily outlined and in other, and perhaps
better ways, that may not yet have occurred to us, our great work
of Conservation is destined to continue its triumphal march upward and
on—in the name of the great principles upon which it is founded, and in
the name of patriots, living and dead, who have labored and sacrificed to
make of this, our fatherland, what, under God, it is, has been, and ever
must remain—the greatest nation on earth. Because, beneath the ample
folds of its unconquered flag, there live more free, happy and God-fearing
people than upon any other part of the habitable globe. (Applause.)</p>


<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>—I had been tempted to introduce the next speaker
as a charter member of the organization of the Daughters of the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
Revolution, but I was told by her that this would be considered
antediluvian, so that I have not any right whatever to use the knowledge
I possess. I have also been told by her friends, for I am sorry to say
that until this meeting we had not known each other, that she is the personification
of patriotism.</p>

<p>It gives me great pleasure to present to this audience the Honorary
Vice-President-General of the Daughters of the American Revolution,
Mrs. John R. Walker, of Kansas City, Mo.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, Mrs. John R. Walker</span></h3>
<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Walker</span>—Madam Chairman, and Ladies and Gentlemen: The
term Conversation has become so all embracing, from the viewpoint of a
Daughter of the American Revolution, it is as much a work of patriotism
as that of our own great organization—the one dealing with the
present and the future, the other with the past, the present and the
future. The motto of the Daughters of the American Revolution is
“Home and Country,” and so lofty is its ideal, so practical its work, it
will be felt throughout all time, as will this broad, wise work of Conservation.
The spirit of commercialism, of money worship, about in the
land, is fast sapping the resources of our great country and begetting a
selfishness that makes a willing sacrifice of the rightful heritage of
future generations. It would seem in the order of things in this work
of Conservation, that the men of our land should give special concern
to its material needs, its lands, its waters, its mineral resources, and that
the conservation of life should appeal as nothing else to woman, the
transmitter of life—Life, a priceless boon. We protest against child
labor—implore with all the tenderness, developed through mother love,
to spare the child in the greed of money getting. Refuse the work of
little hands, and little feet, in factories, mills, and mines, and out of
your abundance make it possible for them, during the few short years of
childhood, to enjoy the freedom of the bird and the butterfly, give them
a memory of Nature’s blessed joys—God’s pure, sweet air; the wayside
flower plucked at will, the willow-shaded stream, and all that the sweet
breast of Nature offers so freely, without money and without price—to
the child of poverty. The Daughters of the American Revolution are
awakened to the realization that we, the home-makers, descendants of
the woman of the spinning wheel, hold the destiny of a nation in our
hands, that we must not only accept but consecrate ourselves to woman’s
highest mission, the crowning glory of womanhood—guiding the young
feet into right paths.</p>

<p>To give patriots to our country, we must rear patriots, train Americans
for America. In our great work of patriotic education our aim
is to train the youth of our land in good citizenship; teach them to battle
for good laws and social conditions, and to be courageous in the fight,
daring to do right in both the political and business world—thus honoring
his birthright. The Daughters of the American Revolution have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
gathered the alien into the fold of the children of the republic, to make
of them true Americans, do for them the best we know how; and many
a lesson we can learn from them of thrift, industry and patience under
discouragement. In my own State opportunity came to such men as
Carl Schurz and Joseph Pulitzer, poor emigrants, who became pre-eminent
in our country’s history. The privileges of the American
woman go hand in hand with her responsibilities, in her zeal for home
and country; she is pointing the way, realizing that our children have
a great work before them, a great problem to solve.</p>

<p>The Jewish dramatist, Zangwill, says: “To think that the same great
torch of liberty, which threw its light across all the broad seas and lands
into my little garret in Russia, is shining also for all those other weeping
millions of Europe, shining wherever men hunger, or are oppressed,
shining over the starving villages of Italy and Ireland; over
the swarming cities of Poland; over the ruined farms of Roumania; over
the shambles of Russia. What is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem,
where all races come to worship and look back, compared to the glory
of America, where all races and nations came to labor and look forward.”
America! great charity of God to the human race.</p>

<p>Conservation of life! As I stand before the shafts erected at Arlington
and Richmond and read to the memory of sixteen thousand who fell
in battle, to the memory of eight hundred unknown dead, my very soul
cries out against war. Eight hundred unknown dead! Can you not
see the long procession of anguished, broken-hearted mothers, waiting
and watching—watching and waiting, and hoping? Our law makers
oppose legislative measures advocating universal peace. How can they
with our Civil War yet fresh in memory, the nations of the earth yet
shuddering over the horrors of the war between Russia and Japan?
The heart sickens at the memory of the undying hatred of the human
heart; the blood thirst for blood in its brutal frenzy, sacrificing her
young men—the hope of a nation—and all for what? One more island,
perhaps, or insignificant kingdom. A war involving principle, as our
Revolutionary War, hundreds of years afterward excites the most passionate
interest and feeling; but wars for power, and possession, the
world cries out against. The time has come to sheathe the sword and
spare mankind. The vast expenditure of money for more destructive
engines of warfare, for the slaughter of men, would go so far in our
work for humanity, the helpless, the unfortunate, the struggling. War
affects not only those who bear arms, but those who stay at home; the
entire country is affected. War retards progress, paralyzes effort; ambition
cannot feed a sorrow, hands are listless and lax when the heart is
heavy. Mrs. Browning’s Italian mother wails: “Both boys dead,
one of them shot by the sea in the East, and one of them shot in the
West by the sea. Dead! both my boys. If your flag takes all heaven,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
with its white, green and red, for what end is it done, if we have not a
son?”</p>

<p>On one occasion, a distinguished Confederate general was a guest at
our table; he had fought from the beginning to the close of the Civil
War. The little boy of the family gazed upon him with awe and admiration.
To know and be close to a great soldier, one who had commanded
armies and fought many battles, was indeed glory for a small
boy. After gazing upon him long and steadily, he startled the assembled
company by saying: “General, how many men have you killed?”
We gasped in horror, wondering what the reply would be. Quickly the
General responded, “I don’t know that I have killed any.”</p>

<p>We read “The Charge of the Light Brigade”; “Scots Who Ha’e Wi’
Wallace Bled,” and other stirring poems of war, and see only the glory
of it. Death by shot and shell and sabre stroke is heroic; but the question
of a little child startles us with the question of our individual responsibility;
we are brought face to face with the words engraven on
the tablets of stone, “Thou shalt not kill.”</p>

<p>Universal peace is no longer a dream. The peace court at The Hague
is established, and marks an epoch in international law. Let us not
cease in our efforts until the pressure of strong public sentiment becomes
so compelling, legislation will be favorable. Our country is the beacon
light; she stands for justice, for freedom, for God; she is the messenger
of the Prince of Peace, is elected to proclaim with trumpet call, peace
to all the nations of the earth and the islands of the sea.</p>

<p>I cannot let this opportunity pass without asking this influential
body of men to throw the weight of its great influence in favor of
another matter taken up by the Daughters of the American Revolution—the
desecration of the flag. I was appointed by our President-General
Mrs. McLean, to speak on the subject before a committee of the United
States Senate, and, with representatives from other patriotic societies,
urged legislation upon it. It is a matter of sentiment, but what is life
without sentiment? With you men laboring for your country’s welfare,
see to it that our country’s emblem is held sacred, shall not be used as
an advertising medium by the soulless money-maker, who cares for
naught save personal gain, who does not consider that this banner stands
for this great country—“your flag and my flag.”</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Chairman</span>—For the past two years the next speaker has been
working in the General Federation as Chairman of the Department of
Conservation. We have worked so closely together, I, as her adviser,
and she doing the large work of the organization, that it is almost like
speaking of one’s own family in introducing this speaker. I shall not
try to tell of her work. We are the very best of Conservation friends to
this day—Mrs. Marion A. Crocker, of Fitchburg, Mass.</p>


<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Crocker</span>—Madam Chairman, and Mr. President and Members
of the Convention: Conservation is a term so apt that it has been borrowed
and made to fit almost all lines of public work, but Conservation
as applied to that department bearing its name in the General Federation
means conservation of natural resources only, and that is a field so
vast that we have found it all that can well be handled under one head
without a chance of neglecting the very principle for which the Conservation
movement was established. And then it is always easier to
come back to simpler things. I do not mean exactly “simpler,” but to
those that touch our lives from day to day, of which we may see the
effect almost from hour to hour, and therefore it seems so unnecessary
to dwell on these things that are far away. The problem of Conservation
of natural resources is so wide and far extended that much of it
must be solved on great government plans, and that seems to make it
even more remote.</p>

<p>Now, we all concede that there is nothing so important as the conservation
of life, of health, education and vital force, so closely connected
with the life. We all grant that, and it is only because the
conservation of natural resources is so closely related to these other lines
that it is of any vital consequence. But, with the other side having
been so strongly emphasized, and, to my sorrow, a few times I have
noticed it even being decried in this conference, it seems to me it has
become my bounden duty to emphasize the other side, because if we do not
follow the most scientific approved methods, the most modern discoveries
of how to conserve and propagate and renew wherever possible those
resources which Nature in her providence has given to man for his use
but not abuse, the time will come when the world will not be able to
support life, and then we shall have no need of conservation of health,
strength or vital force, because we must have the things to support life
or else everything else is useless.</p>

<p>Do not think I am pessimistic. I should not feel this so strongly, but
I feel that this Congress was originally established for the conservation
of natural resources, because the other side had received so much greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
recognition and it is naturally nearer to our hearts. You do not know
how much harder it is to appeal to people for these far-away things
than to those that are so near and dear to them, and the things they can
take hold of in an animate way.</p>

<p>I would like you to review with me just a few of the natural
resources and the result of their Conservation, or the result of a lack of
Conservation.</p>

<p>We will begin with the forests, because in our natural conservation
we consider that the foundation of the fundamental principle of the conservation
of natural resources. And what does the forest for us? What
is the purpose of the forest? Why must we have them? Well, the
forest makes soil in a way; that is, it makes humus matter, which is so
large a portion of the soil that it may well be termed the soil. The
forest is the only crop that grows that gives to the soil more than it
takes from the soil. It also conserves the mineral in the soil that it takes
Nature ages to produce by its slow processes of disintegration, and at the
same time prevents the filling up of reservoirs, lakes and streams, and to
that extent prevents the pollution of the waters. The forest is a great
health resort, and why? Because it actually purifies the air. Its action
is just the reverse of animals. It gives the air what we need and takes
from it that which is detrimental to our health.</p>

<p>We must look a little into plant life and see what nature does that
we may fully appreciate that point. I cannot take time tonight because
of the late hour to go into the whole life of the tree, but I will say that
its principal constituent is carbon, and it takes from the air the carbonic
acid gas which is so detrimental to human beings and to all animals. It
has a way of converting it into its own life blood in combination with
the sap taken up from the roots, by the marvelous process in the leaves,
by this little understood substance called chlorophyll, that has the power
of converting this poisonous substance for us into the life of the tree, and
then taking so much from it and giving it to the soil. That is a most
important factor which is so often overlooked.</p>

<p>Then the forest is valuable as a wind shield for crops. And for the
wood supply. Wood is demanded in all the industries or the arts, for
almost all things we use.</p>

<p>These are the fundamental things the forest does for us. Are we
not working for conservation of strength and health and human life
when we are working for the forest?</p>

<p>While the General Federation takes up many phases of water Conservation,
perhaps I may just say that we have irrigation, drainage,
waterways, the deep canals for transportation, we have water power,
which is the coming thing. This is something to be conserved, and which
conserves our coal, which conserves the purity of our atmosphere by not
having all the gases turned into it by the burning of the coal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<p>All these things it does for us.</p>

<p>And then the very last and most vital is the pure continuous supply
of water, which all human beings and which all animals demand. It is,
next to the air we breathe, the most important factor in animal existence.
Are we not working for health, for strength and for life when we
are working for this pure plentiful water supply, and does not that come
pretty near working directly for conservation of human life? Have
you anything you can bring forward that touches much more nearly the
health, life, strength of human beings, the child, than this same conservation
of water, which is a natural resource?</p>

<p>The soil is indirectly our staff of life. From it does not come our
bread? Must not this seed fall into the ground, spring from the earth
and be protected until it reaches maturity, and we have food? Many
other instances might I bring forward had I time.</p>

<p>Then the animal kingdom is much more nearly related to human
existence than we would think at the outset; but when we come to look
more deeply into it we find this close relationship.</p>

<p>I so often come up against the saying, “Oh, I am so much interested
in human life. I have no time, no thought, no desire to give to the
animal kingdom. It is all right enough for you sentimentalists, but I
am not interested.” Yes, but even from a selfish point of view, if we do
not care at all for any suffering, or anything which may come to the
animal kingdom beside ourselves, it is of economic value to us.</p>

<p>I will choose but one example of the animal kingdom, and that is
the birds, because it is said that all vegetation from the earth would
cease if the birds existed no longer. It is very interesting to know that
Longfellow appreciated this economic value of insectivorous birds long
before there was any movement on foot for bird protection, and I wish
you would all read the poem, the last of the Wayside Inn stories.</p>

<p>This very conservation of bird life is one of the things that is the great
new problem of conservation of natural resources, and one in which you
women take a hand and have the real control. I know you have heard so
much about that I am not going to give you statistics as to what the birds
do for agriculture. I am going to ask you a personal favor: that this fall
when you choose your fall millinery, will you not think of your Chairman
of your Conservation Department of the General Federation, and I beg
you choose some other decoration for your hats. This is not sentiment.
It is pure economics. You have no idea what you do when you wear
these feathers, until you think really deeply into it, and I am not speaking
of the egret, of the paradise feather, wholly, but of the less choice
feathers. There is only one exception to this rule, and that is the wearing
of the ostrich plume. That is a legitimate business and one to be
encouraged. There is no reason why we should not use ostrich plumes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
if so we deem it best, but in regard to everything else in the way of
feathers, let us turn over a new leaf for the fall. Will you not spread
this gospel, not only to yourselves, but all the other women need to be
asked to do the same thing? There are so many other articles, all the
jets, the laces and ribbons. Will you not consider those things, even
leaving out the sentiment?</p>

<p>I might cite for you many examples where conservation of natural
resources works for the betterment of the human race, but I have just
brought up a few of the most important.</p>

<p>Now, I want to say just a few words about the way to go to work to
do some of these things. I will not go into the larger fields of forestry,
or even into shade trees, except to emphasize the fact that while the
shade tree is a very important one, and especially in the cities, we must
never lose sight of the larger fact that after all it is not forestry, it does
not stand for that, and that our arbor day, where we plant the one tree,
should extend far beyond that. But I think one of our primary ways
of working is to begin with the school, perhaps begin with the normal
school. Many of the States have made great progress in that. I really
have not the record of Indiana in that regard. I may be carrying coals
to Newcastle to bring up this subject in Indiana. My own State, Massachusetts,
stands very high in this line. Still I know there are many
States that need this message. There is a great work to be done with
the children, in making the school garden, and then the home garden;
to teach the children to know what the soil is made of and how it should
be treated, to make them love the growing flower and to make them respect
the property of others. There we are laying the foundation of
things for the next generation.</p>

<p>I know perhaps of no better book on the subject than that fine book
for children, “The Land We Live In.” I sent a copy into each State
of the United States last year, with a request to each of my State chairmen
that she do all she could to introduce that work into the libraries of
her State, and the schools, feeling sure that if every child could read
that book or hear it read, he would have a different idea of the natural
resources and the need of natural Conservation. Some of the States
have hundreds and thousands of copies of this book, and I am sure it is
doing a great propaganda work.</p>

<p>I am going to tell you a little story of how I became interested in
these things. It was before I was out of school myself, although pretty
nearly so. It was when the welfare work began of taking the children
out in the country from the slums in the north end. I was personally
acquainted with one of the teachers, who was among the first to take the
children out in the fresh air to breathe and see the grass and flowers and
trees that they had never seen before. One little boy, after he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
looked around in amazement—it was in the fall of the year—saw the
bright red apples on the trees, and he looked up and said, “Apples on
trees, by God!”</p>

<p>It is overwhelming, isn’t it? I don’t wonder that you gasp at it.
But look a little more deeply into it and see the pity of it. That child
had been born and bred in the slums of the north end of Boston and
actually had never seen apples on trees. He had seen apples in barrels.
How did that poor child know that they did not grow in barrels? No,
it had never occurred to him. They did not teach, in those days, the
principles of horticulture in the schools. Was it not pathetic? Doesn’t
that teach a lesson? That has come home to me many and many a time.
I actually believe that was the foundation of my interest in Conservation.
I think I was born with a love of the soil. And the story of the boy
added to that, made me feel that I must know something about nature,
about the fundamental principles, about the other side of life, the vegetable
kingdom that supports the human life. Those two things combined
taught me a lesson that I never, never could forget, and I wish
you would think them over.</p>

<p>I will say to you this one message, while you are working for this
thing of prime importance, the conservation of life, for which this Congress
has stood at this fall meeting, do not forget that the conservation
of life itself must be built on the solid foundation of conservation of
natural resources, or it will be a house built upon the sands that will be
washed away. It will not be lasting. I thank you. (Great applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Paper, Mrs. Elmer Black</span></h3>
<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—I want to have read into the record of this evening’s
proceedings, by title only, a paper which was intended to have
been read by Mrs. Elmer Black, of the International Peace Congress.
She was expecting to be here and was on the program originally, but we
learned that she could not get back from Europe in time to be present.
She sent on her contribution in the way of a paper. It will be published
in the Proceedings. The title is “War is the Policy of Waste—Peace
the Policy of Conservation.” (For Mrs. Black’s paper, see Supplementary
Proceedings.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—I wish to say further that your very gallant
Sergeant-at-Arms, Col. John I. Martin, wants to address the ladies for
just three minutes.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Colonel John I. Martin</span></h3>
<p>Col. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>—Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen: For the
very cordial manner in which you have carried out the suggestion made
by our popular, esteemed and whole-souled President of the National
Conservation Congress, the Hon. J. B. White, that I briefly address this
association, and for your kind invitation, I return my most profound
thanks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>Nowhere in this wide and extended country can there be found a
grander association of noble, unselfish women, planning, acting, counseling
upon the great subject of conservation of human life than this organization
under whose auspices we are all assembled this evening. Nowhere
can there be found an institution more efficient for good, more
blessed in all its labors of love and humanity, more universal in its
application to the advancement of love and sympathy, stimulating education,
encouraging enlightenment and scientific and humane development
and morality, than an institution of the character of this band of
noble women, engaged in such a magnificent undertaking as your association
promulgates. Fully appreciating the fact that as the world
grows better and people become more educated and more honest in their
endeavors to espouse the cause of the weak against the strong, and the
right against the wrong, then such organizations as the Ladies’ Auxiliary
of the National Conservation Congress will be heralded as the very
acme of perfection along the lines of the contemplated work in which
you are now engaged. (Applause.)</p>

<p>In all ages of the world chivalry has yielded to feminine beauty,
patriotism, loyalty and devotion, and I am sure that our popular President,
Captain White, his efficient officers and all the members of the
National Conservation Congress are at all times ready to listen to advice
and counsel from the fair sex, and to surrender with wise discretion to
all her laudable undertakings. (Applause.) Wherever cheeks have
turned pale with waiting, weeping and watching, there was woman’s
presence to cheer, to comfort and to save, and in her garden of the sun
heaven’s brightest rose is yet to bloom, and when it comes it will be the
bright-hued mission of a heavenly charity. The poets have sung no
truer rhyme than that inscribed by one of your own number:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry fs80">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Woman, not she with trait’rous lips her Savior stung,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not she denied him with unholy tongue,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She, when Apostles shrunk, did dangers brave,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Last at the cross, and earliest at the grave.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>God Almighty, in his crowning work of creation, gave woman to man,
made weakness her strength, modesty her citadel, truth, gentleness and
love her attributes, and the heart of man her throne. (Applause.)</p>

</div>


<p>The Congress convened in the Murat Theater, on the morning of
October 4, 1912. It was called to order by President White.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—We will put things through on the ten-minute
plan this morning, so as to give every one a chance who has a place on
the program. Today we have reports from the committees, and elect
our officers. We can then get ready for another Congress, for we are all
going into the field, we are going to work for Conservation, and the
whole country is going to take it up. We will give them the text, and
the press will take it up, the politicians will take it up, and we will each
be a committee of one to go forth through the country and make this
Conservation idea a potent force that will change and correct legislation
for the benefit of all the people. (Applause.)</p>

<p>Mr. A. B. Farquhar, who was to speak this morning, spoke yesterday,
and therefore his address, for which a great many expected to be present,
will be printed and you will have an opportunity to read it. Every
one should subscribe for as many copies of the Proceedings as he can
afford, for distribution among friends. It is without doubt going to
prove to be the greatest book on conservation of human life that has
ever been written. These papers are scholarly, and they are true, and
the truth will prevail if we can only get people to read and to think.
We want to give you all an opportunity to subscribe for this publication,
which will be published as soon as possible, and will only cost one dollar,
and those who pay this dollar will be entitled to membership in this
organization next year, so that if your Mayor, or your Governor, or your
civic body does not reappoint you, you are sure of membership next year,
because you have paid in your dollar and subscribed for the book.</p>

<p>Dr. Livingston Farrand, of New York, will now speak to us on “The
Problem of Tuberculosis.”</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Problem of Tuberculosis”</span></h3>
<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Farrand</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: The problem
of tuberculosis in the United States is simple in its outlines. Stated in
their lowest terms, the figures which describe it are sufficiently impressive
and appalling. Increasing experience and added knowledge serve only
to confirm earlier estimates and to emphasize the seriousness of the situation
which confronts us. The vital statistics of our country are notoriously
faulty and incomplete, but the lesson they teach must arrest
the attention of every thinking citizen.</p>

<p>According to the census of 1910, treating the non-registration area on
the same basis as that from which mortality reports were recorded, there
were 150,000 deaths from tuberculosis in that year. This is, of course,
an under statement by many thousands. Rigidly conservative estimates
agree that the mortality from tuberculosis in this country is at least
200,000 each year and very probably considerably more. Let us for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
moment, however, deal with the demonstrable facts and not enter the
field of estimate.</p>

<p>The real problem is not the number of deaths from tuberculosis, but
the number of living cases of the disease. In calculating this different
methods have been employed. For many years, the ratio of three living
cases to each death was used as an index of the situation in any community.
It was quickly realized by those familiar with the situation
that this proportion was far too low, but with our almost total lack of
registration, figures to demonstrate the discrepancy were not available.
With the improvement in recording the facts of disease in certain typical
centers of population, it became certain, however, that a ratio of five to
one was not only conservative but below the truth.</p>

<p>More recently records of great value have been obtained which confirm
the convictions of experts and allow still sharper definition of the
problem.</p>

<p>It has remained for the city of Cleveland to work out during the past
two years a system of tuberculosis registration and administration which
is undoubtedly the most complete in the country for a community of its
size and complexity. Without going into details of method, notification,
and registration have been brought to such a point in Cleveland that of
all the deaths from tuberculosis now occurring approximately ninety per
cent. have been previously recorded and under observation by the Department
of Health, before death is reported. This is an achievement
for a city of its population of extraordinary significance. There are in
round numbers something over 700 deaths a year from pulmonary tuberculosis
in that city of 600,000 inhabitants. There are in register and
under observation at this time approximately 4,600 cases of tuberculosis.
Allowing for the ten per cent. in the mortality not reported before the
death, it is obvious that the number of living cases is over seven times the
number of deaths and with slight allowance for the very large number
of active cases in any community which have not yet come to diagnosis,
we can demonstrate in that city a ratio of eight living cases for each
death.</p>

<p>It is singularly fortunate that this demonstration has taken place in
a community of sufficient size to include the problems in some degree of
all our larger cities and to be regarded as reasonably typical of the situation
throughout the country. It has also been shown that except for
certain centers, where the problem of congestion is extraordinarily prominent,
the rural situation in the United States does not differ appreciably
from that obtaining in all cities and towns so far as the presence of
tuberculosis is concerned. I have no hesitation, therefore, in asserting
that we must from this time on raise our figures and use a ratio of at
least eight to one in calculating the prevalence of tuberculosis on a basis
of the recorded deaths from that disease.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>Apply these figures to the country. The Bureau of the Census indicates
150,000 deaths a year. On this basis we have 1,200,000 living cases
of tuberculosis. Let us not forget, however, that 150,000 recorded deaths
is far below the actual number, for it is easy to show in most of our communities
that many deaths properly to be assigned to tuberculosis are
reported under other terms, and the area of the United States from
which no statistics are forthcoming includes precisely those States where
the mortality is high and the prevalence of tuberculosis demonstrably
widespread. We are still absolutely certain that the mortality from
this disease is at least 200,000 each year, and the number of living active
cases more than a million and a half.</p>

<p>Such, numerically speaking, is our problem. What are the efforts
for its solution?</p>

<p>Since the discovery of the bacillus as the cause of this disease in 1882,
an organized campaign has gradually been developed. The inferences
from the discovery of the cause were perfectly inevitable and indicated
the lines of operation. It became entirely clear that tuberculosis, being
due to a specific germ, was infectious, and it was equally clear that the
bacillus and its life history being known, the disease was theoretically
preventable. Here, too, the outlines of the campaign are simple, even
though the details of operation are varied and the end in view baffling
to attain.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that the first sporadic efforts based upon slight experience
should have been more or less random, and that years of trial
and proving should precede the establishment of definite method. Some
degree of order is, however, emerging, and we are witnessing an increasing
clearness of purpose and definition of attack in the preventive movement
against tuberculosis which is now sweeping over the country and
the civilized world.</p>

<p>While recognizing the unfortunate complexity of the social conditions
whose maladjustment is perhaps the chief underlying factor in the problem,
while recognizing fully the obligation to lend all possible aid to the
betterment of those conditions, the administration of the campaign
against tuberculosis has still conceived its specific task to be a direct
attack on the sources of infection; this, because experience has indicated
such procedure to be the best and most feasible means of prevention. As
the logical conclusions of laboratory discovery and clinical experience
began to express themselves in organized movement, it was recognized
that the preliminary task in prevention was one of education; an education
which should impress upon the public mind not only the fundamental
facts that tuberculosis is infectious and preventable and the methods
of its infection and prevention, but an education that should bring about
an improved knowledge of public and private hygiene, and particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
an education which should create a public sentiment which could appreciate
conditions and would support and even demand those measures
which expert advice and experience might indicate as necessary. This
educational propaganda, now so familiar, has been in the United States
the particular province of private organization. The union of professional
and lay effort in this latter day crusade has been one of the most
inspiring of social phenomena and has already resulted in accomplishments
of imposing dimensions.</p>

<p>With our political organization such as it is, this enlightened public
sentiment is an absolute essential if the responsibility for the situation
is to be an official one, and not left for the suggestive and stimulating
but less final and efficient efforts of private philanthropy.</p>

<p>The insistence upon official responsibility has been made an essential
point in our American campaign and toward its intelligent acceptance
by public authorities all efforts are directed. As may well be appreciated,
the attainment of this desired end is slow, even though ultimately
inevitable.</p>

<p>In planning the campaign, an ideal program was not difficult to lay
down. It included as fundamental:</p>

<p>1. The education of which I have spoken, not only as it applies to
tuberculosis but as contributing to the solution of that problem of misery
which is, after all, the chief problem of the day and which reduces in the
last instance largely to terms of good or ill health.</p>

<p>2. Enactment or enforcement of protective laws of which the basis
was that notification and registration agreed upon as preliminary to official
knowledge and control of the situation.</p>

<p>3. Adequate institutional provision for all classes of cases; the sanatorium
for the curable; the hospital for the advanced and hopeless, and
dispensaries for early diagnosis and as centers for that all-important
field of action, education and treatment in the homes of the poor.</p>

<p>The developments of the years have not served appreciably to modify
the main features of this program. Emphasis has shifted from time to
time and will continue so to shift, but the fundamentals remain more
firmly established than ever.</p>

<p>In developing the movement in this country, the most effective means
of stimulating action in our various communities has been the voluntary
association for the prevention of tuberculosis. In organizing these societies
the local community has been recognized as the essential centers of
action. The effort has been made, therefore, to obtain in every community
of considerable size an organization embracing elements both
medical and lay which shall charge itself with the task of securing adequate
official treatment of the tuberculosis problem as it there presents
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>In many of our commonwealths such organizations can best be
brought about through the action of a State society, whose special function
becomes one of organization and of securing desired legislation. In
other cases the initiative is local in origin. Where State societies exist,
these act as co-ordinating agents for the affiliated local societies, and the
National Association for the Study and Prevention of Tuberculosis acts
as a clearing house for them all.</p>

<p>It will be seen at once that such organization is but preliminary, and
would be entirely futile, did it not result in preventive measures of a
definite sort. There is, however, no other index equally valuable of the
vigor and growth of this movement in the United States. Speaking from
the national point of view, the organized campaign in this country has
been in existence exactly seven years. In 1905 there were in the entire
country but twenty-one of these societies, while at the present time there
are no less than 660, working in co-operation and presenting a united
front to the enemy. There is no considerable area that does not contain
some such center of intelligent action.</p>

<p>The carrying out of the program outlined a moment ago is the special
function of the organized movement. In the development of this program
it is historically interesting that it was institutional provision for
tuberculosis that first obtained support. It was the sanatorium for the
cure of curable cases with its peculiar appeal which first engaged attention.
From our present point of view, it was perhaps not the logical
beginning, but it was certainly the obvious and perhaps the most fortunate
point of attack. The sanatorium with its promise of restoring to a
wage-earning capacity those unfortunates who formerly had been regarded
as doomed to a speedy and inevitable death, was peculiarly fitted
to arrest public attention and to engage public support.</p>

<p>As the movement for sanatorium establishment developed momentum,
attention turned to the need of special dispensaries as logical centers of
preventive work. Time will not permit even an outline of this phase of
the problem. Suffice it to say that with the first general survey of the
movement in the United States, six years ago, there were in the country
but eighteen dispensaries exclusively devoted to tuberculosis. There are
today more than 400 such foundations and their number is increasing at
a rapid rate. All those who deal hand to hand with the problem become
impressed at once with the fact that tuberculosis is pre-eminently a disease
of social life, of living and working conditions. In the absence of
adequate institutional facilities it is unavoidable that the problem should
be attacked in the homes and workshops of the people, and with such
weapons as may be at hand or which can be devised. With early diagnosis
and careful instructive nursing supervision, much can be done even
in the distressing conditions which characterize the crowded and poorer
quarters of our great cities. The center of activity in this field is everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
the dispensary, and the elaboration of its function to include
supervision in the homes of indigent patients has been one of the most
interesting and important of recent developments.</p>

<p>The third and possibly the most important aspect of institutional
provision was the last to be taken up with energy. Every survey of our
equipment during recent years has served to emphasize the shocking
lack in our facilities for the care of advanced cases of tuberculosis.
It has become increasingly evident that as centers of infection
the consumptive in the advanced stages presented the most serious problem.
Equipped as we were, with a healthily growing movement along
educational, sanatorium and dispensary lines, the time seemed ripe for a
vigorous attack on this point of weakness. The result has been that
during the last four years there has been a concentration of energy in
this direction and a notable advance has been made. Without pausing
to specify various kinds and degrees of hospitals and sanatoria for the
treatment of tuberculosis in the United States, it is encouraging to note
that we now have over 500 in the country, as compared with 111 seven
years ago. The number of beds contained in these institutions is approximately
30,000, a number small when compared with the need, but
encouraging when compared with the situation but a few years since.</p>

<p>The third feature of the program already mentioned, that of legislation,
is less susceptible of numerical expression, but it is in many ways
the most fundamental and most significant of advancing intelligence.
The principle of compulsory notification and registration has been insisted
upon from the outset, and it has now come to be fairly generally
accepted in all parts of the country. With few exceptions the more
important States provide for registration by enactment either of the
Legislature or of the State health authorities. In most of our larger
cities local regulations are also on the statute books. Unfortunately the
enforcement of these regulations is far behind their expression, but the
situation is rapidly improving, and the example of such cities as New
York in initiating the principle, and of Cleveland in demonstrating its
possibilities, is of inestimable value.</p>

<p>In dealing with the question of public hospital establishment, the
best adapted political unit has caused much embarrassment where a given
community is not large enough to support an independent institution.
Federal provision is agreed upon as being out of the question. The
State as such is in most instances regarded as having the same limitations
to a lesser degree as the national government. It is fairly generally
accepted that where the municipality is of sufficient size it should
accept responsibility for its problem. In those sections where communities
of lesser population are the rule, the county is now in the focus of
attention.</p>

<p>Little difficulty has been encountered in procuring the necessary legislation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
for local and county institutional provision. We have now
reached the point where the possibility of mandatory State legislation is
being considered with care and some favor. In this connection one
should note the recent passage by the Legislature of the State of New
Jersey of a law which undoubtedly represents the most advanced legislation
in the United States and probably in the world. Without going into
details, the law in question provides for the establishment of special
tuberculosis hospitals in all the counties of the State, for the payment by
the State of a certain sum ($3.00 per week per patient) toward the maintenance
of such hospitals, for the compulsory segregation in such hospitals
of dangerous and incorrigible cases of the disease, and for the
general supervision of these provisions by the State Board of Health,
though the primary responsibility is placed upon the local health officer.
This legislation is of the highest interest, not only in its promise of
results, but as an enactment into law of principles formulated as necessary
by expert experience even though in advance of public appreciation.</p>

<p>Reaching into every field of social activity as this campaign must do,
it is inevitable that new phases of importance should successively make
their appearance and demand attention. I should say that perhaps the
most striking is the essential importance of the child in the tuberculosis
problem. With improved methods of diagnosis and wider facilities for
examination, there has been shown a prevalence of tuberculosis in children
of school age that is most alarming. It is a conservative statement
that there are today in the public schools of the United States 100,000
children who will die of tuberculosis before they reach the age of eighteen
if the present rate of mortality be continued. A very recent estimate
presented by the United States Bureau of Education states that at
least 15,000,000 children now in attendance in the schools of the United
States are in need of a physician’s attention, and that of this number
1,000,000 have or have had tuberculosis. It has become clear that if
our educational campaign in the interest of preventive medicine and
public health is to achieve success, the attention must be concentrated
upon the coming generation rather than upon those who have already
passed their years of plasticity.</p>

<p>We see, then, on every hand the tendency to attack the problem in
the schools, and this not only by the establishment of provision for open
air teaching and the improvement of the undernourished and the predisposed,
but upon insistence of regular and intelligent instruction as to
the prevention of disease.</p>

<p>Such in its general outlines is the plan by which we are working.
With such a situation and with such a campaign what then is the outlook?
I have little sympathy with the enthusiasm which deals in specific
predictions or which assigns a date for the practical achievement
of theoretical possibilities. It is perhaps inevitable that an impatient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
public should demand results before definite results can be forthcoming.
There is, on the other hand, a corresponding obligation for conservatism
in expression when indicating probable or even possible results. A drop
in the mortality curve of a slowly developing and slowly progressive disease
such as tuberculosis, is not a matter of months but a matter of years.
It is unjustifiable to expect results from the specific campaign against
tuberculosis in an observable diminution of mortality for some years to
come. I believe, however, that we have reached a point where our equipment
is such as adequately to test our basis of operations and to warrant
an optimism as to the future if our reasoning and method be correct.</p>

<p>Believing as we do, that the soundness of the procedure is certain, it
would seem reasonable to expect a response in the mortality tables within
five years, and that ten years should afford indisputable proof.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no doubt that tuberculosis is diminishing and has
been diminishing for a generation. This decrease is not to be assigned
to the specific warfare against the disease, but is doubtless correlated
with other factors. It is uncertain whether we are to assign as its cause
the general improvement in public hygiene or whether there may be
perhaps an acquisition of immunity gradually extending through the
civilized world. In my own judgment this decrease in the prevalence of
tuberculosis is associated with the improvement in hygienic conditions
which has been so marked during the last fifty years. I believe we are
justified in expecting an acceleration in this diminution as a result of the
specific measures now being adopted not only here but in Europe.
While we cannot interpret them with confidence, there are already appearing
certain figures of possible significance. It should not be forgotten
that the first result of all concentrated activity and interest is a
greater accuracy in mortality and morbidity statistics, and that an actual
decrease in tuberculosis might appear in official reports as an apparent
increase in the disease.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into account and viewing the situation candidly
and with all the precautions possible, I do not hesitate to assert
that optimism as to the future is justified, and that the end of the present
decade will witness the beginning of another drop in the mortality curve
comparable to that which was seen in the closing years of the last century.
(Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—Dr. W. C. Mendenhall, of the United States
Geological Survey, at Washington, was expected to be here this morning
to speak upon the subject of “Water as a Natural Resource.” He is
unable to be present, and Mr. Jacob P. Dunn, Secretary of the Indiana
Historical Society, will now have ten minutes to discuss “The Conservation
of Navigable Streams.”</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Conservation of Navigable Streams”</span></h3>
<p>(For Mr. Dunn’s paper see Supplementary Proceedings.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—The subject of the next address is “Social, Industrial
and Civic Progress.” It is to be a review of fifty years of what
has been done in labor economics, by one who has given a great deal of
study to the subject, Mr. Ralph M. Easley, of New York City, Chairman
of the Executive Council of the National Civic Federation.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Social, Industrial and Civic Progress”</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Easley</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: In view of the
fact that the work of the Committee on Civics was not outlined at the
time it was organized, and as it was the desire of the national officers of
the Conservation Congress that its work should not duplicate nor overlap
the work of other organizations, the mapping out of a practical program
for the committee was deferred until this meeting of the Congress.</p>

<p>Recognizing this situation, the officers of the Congress suggested that,
as Chairman of the Committee on Civics, I should briefly review the
progress that has been made by others in this country along industrial,
social and civic lines. This seemed to me wise because at a gathering of
this kind, which has discussed conditions that call for improvements, it
might be helpful to note what progress our country has already made
along these lines. To look back adown the slopes we have so painfully
and undauntedly climbed in advancing to our present plane of material
and moral welfare, far from inspiring us with a smug complacency,
should heighten our resolves and give renewed energy and freshness of
spirit.</p>

<p>Another reason for accepting the suggestion is that I had just read
in an English newspaper a sweeping and vitrolic criticism of our social
and civic conditions. Our unkind critic spoke of us as a people so
utterly bound up in the worship of the “almighty dollar” that we had
lost whatever social vision might have illumined the minds of our fathers.
To all sense of social righteousness we were as a people pitiably indifferent.
In mill, factory and mine our working people slaved; in tenement
and farmhouse our poor lived, little if any better than the poorest
of Europe’s poor; our sick and otherwise helpless were scarcely given a
thought. Politically we were rotten to the core, statesmanship and
graft going hand in hand.</p>

<p>That, in short, ours was a dog-eat-dog civilization, and that the only
direction in which light might be seen breaking was in the “fact that
making headway among the wisest and most far-seeing Americans was
the conviction that American institutions were a failure!”</p>

<p>The editorial concluded with the statement that if any one considered
that view a biased one, all such skeptical readers need do was to
acquaint themselves with the writings and speeches of American sociologists
and magazine writers or to converse with any of that “dwindling
proportion” of our well-informed citizens to whom human values are not
a mere academic phrase or an abstraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span></p>

<p>It is unnecessary to point out that our English critic might have used
his columns to better advantage if he had differentiated between the
sociologists and magazine writers who seek our country’s good and those
who seek only its destruction—a very important differentiation to make
at this time.</p>

<p>In fact, our critic may be a Socialist, who is only passing along to
England the general cry of the pessimists of this country, that “whatever
is, is wrong”; and that there is a great unrest in the industrial
world which will, sooner or later, burst out in volcanic force and engulf
us in a terrible cataclysm—all of which is unspeakable rot.</p>

<p>I think I am in a position through the organization with which I am
connected (composed as it is of the representatives of the great labor,
agricultural, manufacturing, banking, commercial, educational and professional
organizations) to know something about this “great unrest”
upon which the Socialists and other radical writers and speakers declaim
so much, and I can assure you that the only unrest in the industrial and
social fields that I can discern is that wholesome, normal unrest which
comes through the education of the people, and therefore a better understanding
of their rights as workers and the translation of that knowledge
through the labor unions and other social and economic organizations
into concrete demands for better living conditions.</p>

<p>But let us take a birdseye view of the situation and see whether we
are advancing or going backward. I think you will agree with me that
the following bare outline of a few of the important achievements and
the work now being done by organizations and movements of public-spirited
citizens is inspiring and encouraging.</p>

<p>Let us start with the industrial gains.</p>

<p>The American Federation of Labor and the railway brotherhoods
have in the past twenty-five years secured better wages and working
conditions for millions of wage-earners and the eight-hour day for hundreds
of thousands, and they have developed a system of collective bargaining
and methods of conciliation and arbitration that are reducing
the number of industrial disturbances. To get a clear idea of what this
means in terms of progress, let us consider that while in the past six
months 500,000 coal miners and their employers have made contracts
covering wages, hours and conditions of employment for a term of four
years; all the railroads east of Chicago are arbitrating their differences
with their thousands and thousands of engineers, trainmen, conductors
and so on; the hundreds of thousands of carpenters, bricklayers, painters,
plasterers and others of the thirty-five crafts involved in the building
industry have made contracts with associations of builders all over the
land from Maine to California; while the publishers of the great daily
newspapers throughout the United States have made a five-year contract
with their printers, pressmen, stereotypers, etc.; and the street railway<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
employes in many great cities and many others of the 135 crafts belonging
to the American Federation of Labor have made satisfactory contracts
with their employers—I say, let us consider that while this is what
is going on today in this country, we shall not have to go very far back
into history to find the time when it was a penal offense for a man to
join a labor organization, or for workers to ask collectively for an increase
in wages, and to find that, while we are now legislating in the interest of
the employe for a minimum wage, at that time the effort of legislation
was for a maximum wage in the interest of the employer.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the State factory legislation has revolutionized the
methods of sanitation in the workshops of the country and is safeguarding
better and better the lives and limbs of the workers.</p>

<p>Employers are making increased provision for the welfare of their
employes through sanitary and safe work places, opportunities for recreation
and education, model homes rented or sold, and relief funds for
sickness, accident and death benefits, as well as old age pensions, all affecting
millions of railroad, factory, mine and department store workers.</p>

<p>The National Child Labor Committee has led a campaign that in ten
years has secured wholesome legislation in practically every State in the
Union, reducing hours of labor, prohibiting children under fourteen
years of age from working in factories, mines and mills, and preventing
night work for women and children in many places.</p>

<p>The tenement house reform movement in New York alone, where the
problems are greatest, has made seventy-five per cent. improvement in
fifteen years; and as an example of the growing recognition of big business
of its social responsibility, it may be pointed out that when the
Supreme Court upset the Tenement House Law, and by a decision wiped
out all that had been accomplished in twelve years through the tenement
house agitation, the allied real estate interests in New York joined with
the tenement house reformers in securing the passage of a State law and
a city ordinance correcting the defects.</p>

<p>Amazing in magnitude and usefulness are the health organizations,
public and private, devoted to securing more efficient methods of sanitation
and the prevention of disease, recent statistics in New York City
showing as a result of such work that the mortality rate has decreased
fifty per cent. in fifty years.</p>

<p>There are various national and local organizations devoted to the
protection and education of the millions of immigrants from all parts
of the world who have landed on these shores in the past ten years, and
whose assimilation and adaptation to American standards and conditions
have constituted one of the problems of the age.</p>

<p>There are thousands of non-sectarian hospitals and institutions for
the scientific care of dependents, defectives and delinquents.</p>

<p>Splendid work is being done by the great charity organization movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
which is teaching independence and thrift through its penny provident
societies, and which has organized some of the most important
preventive and remedial agencies.</p>

<p>The National Federation of Remedial Loan Societies covers twenty-eight
cities, where societies lend money to the poor at reasonable rates to
protect them from the loan sharks, the New York organization alone
having a fund of millions for this purpose. A rapidly increasing number
of large employers have changed their attitude towards their employes,
in that they now aid instead of discharging those who incur debt—the
latter policy having played directly into the hands of the loan
sharks.</p>

<p>The National Association for the Promotion of Industrial Education
has brought the manufacturers’ associations and the labor organizations
into harmonious support of the measure providing a federal appropriation
of $5,000,000 for industrial education of the young workers in
towns and cities, whether in factories, stores or offices, and including
domestic science for the girls. The measure also provides an equal
amount for the sons and daughters of the farmers.</p>

<p>The tremendous program of constructive work undertaken by the
United States Bureau of Labor and the Bureau of Mines in the interest
of the workingmen and by the Department of Agriculture for the farmers
should alone silence our English scoffer. The recent establishment of
the Children’s Bureau is an achievement of which humanitarians may
well be proud.</p>

<p>The public school system and other free educational institutions
enable the children in this country today to receive twelve times as much
schooling as their grandparents—a tremendous factor in our advancement
of itself and one that readily accounts for much of the unrest without
which no progress could come.</p>

<p>The universities, especially the State institutions, have in the past
ten years enlarged the scope of their work to such an extent that many
of them can be classed as leaders in what are termed the “uplift movements”
of the day. A complete catalogue of the public work done by
the University of Wisconsin alone would be a revelation.</p>

<p>The Playground and Recreation Society of America and other recreation
movements are assisting in the development of children’s playgrounds
in parks and schools and are bringing health and good cheer to
congested centers.</p>

<p>The Association for Labor Legislation is working jointly with the
American Medical Association to safeguard wage-earners against occupational
diseases.</p>

<p>The American Bankers’ Association is organizing a movement to help
the farmers of the country develop idle land in the effort to decrease the
cost of living.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span></p>

<p>One of the most encouraging signs to those who are alarmed over the
high cost of living, and that is about all of us, is the recognition by the
farmers, State agricultural colleges and railroads, of the necessity of
introducing up-to-date methods for raising and marketing grain, live
stock, fruit, dairy produce, etc. Only last week I read the announcement
of a convention called in Kansas, where three thousand delegates
will meet to consider this very question of improving the methods of
farming. These delegates will represent not only farmers but also the
bankers, merchants, wage-earners and all divisions of society.</p>

<p>It would take a volume to describe even in outline the great social
and economic reforms being promoted by Mr. Andrew Carnegie, Mrs.
Edward H. Harriman, Mrs. Russell Sage and Mr. John D. Rockefeller,
whose $60,000,000 gift covers the promotion and development of the
high school system in the Southern States and the promotion of higher
education throughout the United States, while his Sanitary Commission
has discovered and is eradicating the hookworm disease in the South.
The Carnegie Institute of Washington, with an endowment of $22,000,000,
was founded to encourage in the broadest and most liberal manner
investigation, research and discovery, and the application of knowledge
to the improvement of mankind, while the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching, with its $15,000,000 endowment, provides retiring
pensions for the teachers of universities, colleges and technical
schools. The Russell Sage Foundation, endowed by Mrs. Sage with
$10,000,000, has, for its purpose the improvement of social and living
conditions in the United States of America.</p>

<p>There are the tremendous achievements through the institutional
work of the churches of all denominations. Three-fourths of the efforts
in the live churches of today are devoted to material welfare, as is evidenced
by the especial care of the orphan, the sick and the poor on the
part of the Catholic Church; the great Hebrew philanthropic and educational
agencies; and such single illustrations as the social work outlined
in the handbooks just issued by Trinity and St. George’s parishes
in New York—the former being a revelation to those who believed that
the millions of Trinity Church were being used only for commercial
profits.</p>

<p>The Young Men’s Christian Association, with its tremendous energy
and enthusiasm, while organized primarily to promote the spiritual
growth of young men, has lately, under its “physical and social well-being”
clause, gone into the field of industrial betterment with conspicuous
success.</p>

<p>The Men and Religion Forward Movement and the Federation of
Churches, representing many million members of Protestant denominations,
have recently adopted broad programs of industrial and social
reform.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span></p>

<p>There are the movement to suppress the social evil, known as the
Federation of Sex Hygiene; the Anti-Tuberculosis Society, with its
wonderfully comprehensive and successful efforts in fighting the great
white plague; the Red Cross Society which, in addition to relieving distress
in great disasters, has fostered with marked success annual competitive
drills of “first-aid” crews from the mines; the Boy Scouts of America,
inculcating patriotism and good citizenship; the National Consumers’
League; the New York Museum of Safety and Sanitation; the Prison
Labor Reform Association, and hundreds of other organizations and
movements devoted to human betterment too numerous even to mention
by title.</p>

<p>And last, but not least, there is the educational work being done by
the National Civic Federation through its Departments on Conciliation,
Compensation for Injured Workmen, Industrial Welfare, Pure Food
and Drugs, Reform in Legal Procedure, Regulation of Interstate and
Municipal Utilities, Regulation of Industrial Corporations and Uniform
State Legislation.</p>

<p>As much of the work of the various departments of the National Civic
Federation called for uniform State legislation, a special department was
organized to co-operate with the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.</p>

<p>The importance of uniformity to all business and commercial institutions
is clearly recognized, when we consider that our larger corporations—such
as the railroads, telegraph, insurance, banking and trust
companies and, in fact, so far as taxation is concerned, all manufacturing
concerns whose plants are in different States—are subject to forty-eight
masters, each with a mind quite different from that of the others. The
“interminable” law’s delay, the clashing of the States upon the question
of regulation of corporations and combinations, the diversity of State
laws on ordinary commercial matters, such as warehouse receipts, bills
of lading and negotiable notes, the urgent need for a uniform bill on
compensation for industrial accidents, all give emphasis to the need for
uniformity. But even this chaotic legislative situation shows encouraging
signs of clearing up.</p>

<p>So much for progress along industrial and social lines; but we have
made and are making just as great progress in this country along other
lines that affect the general welfare of the people. And also our ethical
standards and our aspirations are conspicuously higher. For instance:</p>

<p>Within the past twenty years there has been a most remarkable gain
in the popular concept of the relation of industrial, railway and municipal
utility corporations to the public. The large corporations called
trusts have been taught even in the past five years that they must recognize
certain “rules of the game” that give their competitors a chance,
and what is wholesome about this from the ethical standpoint is that
they now admit the justice of these changed conditions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span></p>

<p>The abolition of rebates and free passes and the placing of railroad,
telegraph, telephone and express companies absolutely under the regulatory
power of the Interstate Commerce Commission are so far-reaching
that the benefits to the people are impossible to measure. From federal
regulation of railroads, it was only a step to State regulation of street
railway, gas and electric light companies.</p>

<p>The idea that railways or big corporations are masters of the people
has been dissipated.</p>

<p>Today, through insistent demand of the people for publicity, it can
be said that the big business of the country is being done behind glass
doors. The improved methods of doing business adopted by banks, trust
companies and insurance companies during the past five years would
alone justify this statement.</p>

<p>In practically five years, thanks to the great educational work of the
National Conservation Congress, there has been a complete transformation
of the public mind in the matter of proper control of our natural
resources, such as our public lands, timber and water power. It was not
many years ago, when I was living in the West, that it was considered a
smart thing to “grab off” all public land that one could get hold of.
This was generally accomplished by taking land in the name of your
mother and father and all your children, past, present and future, and
it was not bad form even to use your neighbor’s name in taking up
claims. I found my own name had been used in three or four different
counties by some of my ambitious neighbors.</p>

<p>Politically speaking, we have progressed from the state where our
elections were great public scandals and where primary elections were
“free-for-alls,” with no legal status whatever, to a day when, thanks to
the Australian ballot law, ballot-box stuffing is practically unknown and
primaries are generally so conducted that the voters control.</p>

<p>Campaign contributions that were largely responsible for corruption
in politics and legislation are now by law made public to the world.</p>

<p>The initiative, referendum and direct primary have been adopted in
some form in two-thirds of the States and in over two hundred cities the
commission form of government, often with a recall attachment, has been
adopted. These measures, whether they prove to be practical reforms or
not—and there are many who doubt that—undeniably testify to the
paramount power of those agitating for a so-called “progressive program,”
they all being opposed by what are termed the “reactionaries.”</p>

<p>The civil service, from being a thing detested by nearly everybody
twenty years ago, is so popular today that political parties are vying
with each other to see which can include the largest number of civil
employes. The President has just ordered the 35,000 fourth-class post-masters
be taken from under the political brokerage offices of the Congressmen
and placed under the civil service law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>The government of cities, which has been the burning shame of this
country, as it was in the early days of every other country, is slowly but
surely becoming more decent and effective. The work of the National
Municipal League, the hundreds of local municipal reform associations,
and the National Bureau of Municipal Research with its local bureaus,
furnish abundant evidence of the truth of this statement. The Bureau
of Municipal Research is not only making an exhaustive and painstaking
analysis of administrative methods in many large cities, and installing
more up-to-date and efficient systems, but it also has prevailed upon the
Federal Government to have a similar investigation made in its various
departments. It has, in addition, organized a training school to meet
the demand for municipal experts.</p>

<p>The administration of justice and the influence of wealth upon the
decisions of the courts have been revolutionized in the past ten years.
It used to be charged that the criminal courts convicted only the poor
and released the rich, whereas today the penitentiary that has not a half
dozen or more bankers or rich malefactors within its walls is the exception.
There is no man or corporation so powerful today as to be immune
from attack by the government when violating the law.</p>

<p>The American Bar Association and the National Civic Federation are
jointly working to bring about a reform in legal procedure which will
wipe out unnecessary delays and cost in litigation, thereby opening the
courts more freely to the wage-earner.</p>

<p>Five years ago there was no such thing as a Pure Food and Drug
Law. Today there is a federal act which has been made the basis of
legislation in thirty-five States, and in another five years it is likely to
be practically impossible for misbranders or adulterators of food and
drugs to live outside of our penal institutions.</p>

<p>The rural free delivery, the postal savings bank and the parcel post
are all great advances from which the farmers largely benefit.</p>

<p>The building and loan associations and savings banks, unknown in
early days, are great aids to wage-earners.</p>

<p>In other words, reform is writ large over all sections of the country
and all classes of society. There are:</p>

<p>Over two thousand boards of trade and chambers of commerce, at
least half of whose efforts are directed towards municipal and industrial
reforms, and the other half to commercial reforms;</p>

<p>Thousands of church societies and committees aiding in the improvement
of industrial, social and political conditions in their respective
localities;</p>

<p>Thousands of women’s clubs, representing over two million of the
brightest and most energetic women of our nation, devoted to securing
civic improvement, factory legislation and reforms in public schools, to
spreading information upon social hygiene and domestic science and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
working for the protection of women and the redemption of unfortunate
ones;</p>

<p>Thirty thousand labor organizations, whose purpose is not only to
secure better working conditions, better wages and a shorter workday
for wage-earners, but also to lift them to a higher plane of citizenship,
and</p>

<p>Millions of farmers who, through granges, alliances and institutes,
are working not only to improve the home life on the farm, but to educate
their children in the use of better and more scientific methods of
production.</p>

<p>Pretty fair, is it not, for a people whom our English critics and our
American Socialists say are bereft, or almost so, of a social sense?</p>

<p>And it must also be kept in mind that this resumé does not refer to
progress in science, invention and the arts, nor is attention called to the
fact that never before in the history of this country were the basic conditions
better than they are now, despite the fact that a national political
campaign is supposed to be on.</p>

<p>But while the progress made has been so tremendous that we do not
realize it, on none of these lines is it contended that anything near the
ideal has been reached. There are yet very many black places and perplexing
problems demanding attention on the part of those who love their
fellow-men. But the same courage, intelligence and humanitarianism
that have accomplished so much will not now falter, but will press forward.</p>

<p>Many in this audience may conclude that I am unduly optimistic and
that I am able only to see the good, but I can assure you that I know
something as well about the ills of society; for instance, I could cite
from the records of the Welfare Department of the National Civic Federation
alone a catalogue of industrial horrors showing where greedy
and thoughtless, if not unfeeling and criminal, employers are grossly and
outrageously mistreating the wage-earners in their employ, paying them
atrociously low wages, working them excessively long hours and giving
no consideration to the comforts or decencies that a humane employer
would furnish. But also from that same record I could show that all
such evils are being met by other employers, justifying the belief that,
through education and proper agitation, the remaining sore spots can
be removed. Last year one great corporation alone spent five millions
of dollars in betterment work, including a gradual shortening of the
working time in its plans for improving conditions, and several large
corporations, operating night and day, have gone from two twelve-hour
shifts to three eight-hour shifts without decrease of pay.</p>

<p>As a concrete and striking example of the power of agitation and
education, there can be no better illustration than the present widespread
sentiment in favor of legal enactments requiring compensation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
to injured wage-earners in lieu of the old employers’ liability system.
Through the work of the National Civic Federation and co-operating
bodies, this complete reversal of policy has been brought about in four
years, fourteen States having already passed workmen’s compensation
laws. The legislation, both Federal and State, which is now being
secured, makes the industry bear the burden, while before the wage-earner
took all the chances, did all the suffering and, if, after long-drawn-out
litigation, he finally got anything in the way of damages, he
had to give up fifty per cent. of it to the “ambulance chaser.”</p>

<p>I am happy to state that a movement is now on foot to make a painstaking
inquiry into the progress made during the past fifty years in
the directions indicated, with a view not only to discovering the good,
but also to ascertaining what social and economic ills remain to be eradicated,
and to propose, as far as possible, practical remedies therefor.</p>

<p>It is believed that a movement which will recognize the good and
sincerely seek to remedy the wrong would be more effective in accomplishing
reform than one designed only to tear down and destroy.</p>

<p>It were well, and with this suggestion I conclude, if at all future
gatherings of this great organization some such counting of the milestones
passed were to be made a feature. There is good reason for this.
There are among our ninety millions of people many who, strange as it
may seem, interpret such occasions as this as diagnostic of a body-social
sick nigh unto death as the result of neglect. They do not know—and
the fault is not wholly theirs—that the patient, far from being in extremis,
is in better condition than ever before, that what to them is a
death chamber consultation is merely an evidence of periodical stock
taking in terms of social health and welfare. (Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—This is certainly a truthful resumé. It is well
for us all sometimes to stop and “count our blessings.” (Applause.)</p>

<p>We will now listen to Dr. Burton J. Ashley, of Morgan Park, Illinois.
His subject is “Disposition of Sewage,” a very interesting aspect of
Conservation.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Disposition of Sewage”</span></h3>
<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Ashley</span>—The universal aim of every one is to succeed. Success
in anything depends, it is aptly said, on one’s ability, reliability, endurance,
and action—four personal requisites, the absence of any one of
which means failure. Ability and reliability are personal qualities, while
endurance and action, two of these four requisites, are physical endowments
dependable on one’s health. Accepting these statements as correct,
then half of our successes is dependable on personal health and one-half
on personal quality.</p>

<p>If man’s successes are equally as dependable on health as on his
mental or acquired qualities or abilities, then we must draw but one
conclusion, viz., that as much attention should be given to the maintenance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
of a healthy body as to the use and maintenance of our mental and
moral capabilities.</p>

<p>Healthfulness depends in part on cleanliness, the state or quality of
being clean. Health is natural. Disease is unnatural and is the result
of some known or unknown transgression of natural laws. Dirt and
disease have always been good friends. Disease is always most flourishing
when it has dirt and filth for company; and to be dirty or filthy is
to transgress nature’s efforts at keeping the body well.</p>

<p>Water and food are essential to life. Consume them and the liquid
waste produce is sewage filth. To man the foulest and most repulsive
dirt or filth is that of his own daily making, and well that it is, for it
contains the most poisonous substances that exist and civilized humanity
everywhere is increasingly directing its efforts to accomplish its destruction
in the most sanitary and economical way possible. Modern methods
employed by cities or lesser municipalities to disposal of their liquid filth
is that of establishing systems of underground drains called sewers, into
which such liquid filth is discharged.</p>

<p>The first well designed sewerage system to be adopted in the United
States was built in Chicago about the year 1855.</p>

<p>The modern water-closet was not evolved until early in the last century,
and in consequence of which evolution water carriage as a means
of conveying sewage away logically followed its introduction. Former
designs of sewerage provided for drains that would accommodate both
the storm waters as well as the sewage. This method is commonly known
as the “Combined System,” but when the employment of this character
of sewage disposal created nuisances, the demand arose for the abatement
of said nuisances, and it was then that civilization faced sewage
purification in some form as a remedy. Storm waters are only dirty
waters and not, strictly speaking, polluted waters, for merely dirty water
will not create an offensive nuisance and requires no purification, while
polluted water does. So the “separate system” of sewers was then
evolved, namely, where one system conveys the storm waters and a separate
system the sanitary sewage, for, inasmuch as only sanitary sewage
needs purifying, therefore works of smaller capacity are needed than
would be required were the large and unsteady volume of storm waters
to be also subjected to the purifying process.</p>

<p>Many experiments have been made and varying forms of sewage purifying
plants have been built during the last half century, and out of the
many failures there have been evolved a few processes of purification
which have proven fairly successful, but from an economic standpoint
as well as from a physical one much yet has to be gained.</p>

<p>The broad irrigation of land with raw or crude sewage has been tried
out and its limitations discovered. Although physically successful when
properly administered, this form of disposal has been found to be expensive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
Existing costly land values are usually exceedingly against the
adoption of this form of disposal. The Broad Irrigation Plant of Berlin,
Germany, with her 43,000 acres of land, is a notable example of the
continuance of this form of disposal, but while this scheme has through
its years of usefulness sometimes shown profits and sometimes deficits,
the profits have never been large enough to pay the interest and sinking
fund charges on the capital expended on the purchase of farms.</p>

<p>The method of purification now in general use is what is broadly
called the biological method, wherein nature’s own mysterious forces,
viz., putrefaction and nitrification, are encouraged usually by first impounding
the sewage and then nitrifying the impounded liquid in a
filter bed, so called.</p>

<p>This form of sewage purification is found to require a minimum
amount of manipulation or labor as compared with some of the other
forms.</p>

<p>The plea for sewage disposal is that it enhances life by preventing
disease. The United States Conservation Commission reported that
eighty-five per cent. of typhoid and malaria are preventable.</p>

<p>The sewage disposal problem is by no means an easy one, for every
case being a law unto itself is sure to present a greater or less number
of physical conditions that may not be found in any other case. Sewages
differ in their composition as people differ. Some sewages are easily
controlled and gotten rid of, while other sewages are stubborn to almost
refusing to be subdued. The sanitary engineer in arriving at determination
is obliged to previously dig deep and acquaint himself with existing
conditions before he can safely conclude upon designs or measures or
means that will bring successful results. The sanitary engineer’s practice
is therefore much like that of a physician who considers symptoms
before offering a diagnosis or prescribing a remedy.</p>

<p>Contrivances that have worked successfully in England have often
proven to be failures in the United States. The character and composition
of sewage abroad differs widely from the composition of our greatly
diluted sewage here. Latitude, quantity of contained manufacturing
wastes, character of water supply and numerous other components all
combine to make the art of sewage disposal a problem. For instance,
when the water supply is what is commonly termed “hard” undue collection
of scum or mat is almost sure to form in biological tanks, and this
is only one of the innumerable vexatious enigmas that confront the engineer
or biologist. Pioneer practitioners have frequently undertaken the
solution of sewage disposal questions when not qualified for such duty,
largely in answer to the urgent request of an impecunious public with
the usual disappointing results. But the value and possibilities of health
Conservation have now been brought to that degree of successful accomplishment
where the demand for specialists in the advancement of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
modern art has become enhanced, and the advisability of employing
specialists when the nature of the work is of such vital importance as is
sewage disposal needs no argument.</p>

<p>Mr. Winslow has told us that a badly constructed or badly operated
system is worse than none at all, for it creates a sense of false security
and it also breeds a sense of distrust.</p>

<p>The first city to go about the establishment of sewage disposal in a
thoroughly exhaustive way was Columbus, Ohio. Its example was shortly
followed by the cities of Baltimore and Philadelphia. Very elaborate
and exhaustive experiments are now being made by the city of Chicago
at an experimental plant costing $60,000, which experiments have already
covered a period of over two years, so that when a report shall be
forthcoming the character of disposal best suited to that city will be a
known factor and such steps as will be taken will be along lines of certainty.</p>

<p>The whole civilized world is or should be deeply indebted to the far-reaching
experiments that have been conducted since the year 1887 at
Lawrence, Mass., by the Massachusetts State Board of Health. The
annual reports of the findings have become classic both at home and
abroad. Nor would we forget to mention particularly the fifth report
of the English Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal, which, after
making exhaustive observation covering a period of four years of the
operation of twenty-seven sewage disposal plants in actual daily operation,
gave information, the value of which to the sanitary expert and
indirectly to the civilized world at large, may not be determined.</p>

<p>At this stage of sanitary advancement our common people should not
be further excused for the density of their ignorance regarding the value
of preventive medicine as exemplified in clean premises and person and
the adopting of respectable sanitary conveniences.</p>

<p>Want of knowledge along lines of modern sanitary advancement is to
a very large extent due to the inertness of legislatures in enacting laws
to meet the modern sanitary needs. The passing and enforcing of such
laws would surely force our ignorance on this subject out of us and place
us on a higher hygienic plane, such as has been established by the excellent
enactments in a few of our States.</p>

<p>Standing out pre-eminently in this respect are the laws relating to
the public health in Massachusetts, with New York following as a close
second. One of the most important laws which is the foundation of
others in Massachusetts is a provision for the acquirement of land by
cities and towns for the purification of sewage. All through the Massachusetts
code are to be found an abundance of preventive measures, as
well as curative—abatement of nuisances, of offensive trades; establishing
water supply and sewage disposal. Then follows a long list of subjects
spell as lying-in hospitals, dangerous diseases, spitting, drinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
cups, protection of infants, vaccination, quarantine, public school inspection,
diseases of domestic animals, hydrophobia, cemeteries, cremating of
dead bodies, burials, bakeries, supervision of plumbing, pollution of
streams, food and drugs, milk, registry of births, marriages and deaths—not
one of which but has its peculiar relation to the producing of sewage,
and indirectly with sewage disposal.</p>

<p>As a contrast with the Massachusetts code let me refer to the sanitary
laws, or want of them, in the State of Illinois. According to a copy of
the public health laws issued for the information of local health authorities
and others of this State, there occurs, for instance, but two sections covering
the establishing of sewers. Rules and regulations are in evidence for
isolating, quarantining, disinfecting and coping with various infectious
diseases after they come into existence, but not a statutory provision is to
be found establishing sewage disposal, nor for preventing the pollution
of streams and lakes. The State Board of Health in this State is well-nigh
powerless in taking initiative steps, particularly with regard to
sewage disposal and stream pollution. It is high time State legislatures
betook themselves to looking more into the all important art of sanitation
and its far-reaching results and at once enact laws that will meet the
advanced requirements of our daily living, and give such attention to
the conservation of health and to the physical welfare of our homes as it
in some cases has given to the welfare of the barn, the pigsty and their
occupants. Had I the time I could refer to some very astonishing facts
that might cause the blush of negligence to come to the faces of our
Hoosier legislators.</p>

<p>Ohio has recently enacted a code of plumbing and drainage laws, containing
provisions supposed to cover scientific sewage disposal. This
code provides for and encourages contrivances that have been most
soundly condemned by leading sanitarians both in this country and
abroad for a century past.</p>

<p>It was Eugene Field who said:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry fs80">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“It seems to me I’d like to go</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where bells don’t ring or whistles blow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor clocks don’t strike nor gongs don’t sound,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And I’d have stillness all around,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Not real stillness, but just the trees</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Low whispering of the hum of bees.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>What this tender poet wrote several years ago is increasingly being
enacted today by the exodus of the prosperous captains of industry, of
commerce and of the professions from their narrow city confines in unneighborly
city neighborhoods to well appointed habitations in the outlying
suburbs, or in his comfortable summer home up in the mountains
or alongside the beautiful waters of some inland lake. These prosperous
friends, though removing to the country, are unwilling to yield up any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
of the comforts and conveniences afforded by municipal service. Sewers
usually unavailable in these more or less remote locations causes sewage
disposal to become at once one of their most vexatious problems, so here
comes a new demand for special skill in aiding our country gentlemen
in establishing a satisfactory sanitary service that will tend to his comfort
and respectability and prevent a menace to life and health. So all
along the line the requirements for the sanitary uplift of home surroundings
is widening, and the requirements in the daily living is enhancing,
for modern sanitary methods of which sewage disposal is the most important
are found to be most effective and therefore more necessary in the
conservation of man’s most valuable asset—health. (Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—While waiting for committee reports, we will hear
from a gentleman from San Francisco, who asks a little time. I will
introduce to you Mr. J. P. Baumgartner.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. J. B. Baumgartner</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baumgartner</span>—I just want to say to you that San Francisco will
be in the field at the proper time with an invitation to this Congress to
meet in that city in 1915—the year of the Panama-Pacific International
Exposition. The State of California has raised twenty million dollars
for this Exposition. There will be a million-dollar convention auditorium
on the Exposition grounds, and we feel there are many reasons why
it would be particularly fitting for this Congress to meet in that city
that year. I do not want to press this matter unduly at this time, but I
felt I had a duty to perform to tell you that we want you to come to
San Francisco in 1915, and that we will extend to you a royal welcome.
I thank you. (Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—There is a committee to report at this time. The
Chairman of the Executive Committee, Mr. E. L. Worsham, will report
on some amendments to the Constitution.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Report, Executive Committee</span></h3>
<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">Worsham</span>—Mr. President and Members of the Congress:
The Executive Committee makes the following recommendations for
changes in the Constitution of the National Conservation Congress:</p>

<p>That the following be added as Section 3, Article III:</p>

<p>“After a call of the Executive Committee by the Chairman, and after
all members of the committee have been notified of the meeting in sufficient
time to be present, three members shall constitute a quorum for the
transaction of business.”</p>

<p>That Article IV, Section 1, be amended as follows:</p>

<p>“Section 1. The officers of the Congress shall consist of a President,
to be elected by the Congress; a Vice-President, to be elected by the
Congress; a Vice-President from each State, to be chosen by the respective
State delegations; one from the National Conservation Association
and one from the National Association of Conservation Commissioners;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
an Executive Secretary, a Recording Secretary, and a Treasurer, to be
elected by the Congress.”</p>

<p>That in Article V, Section 1, the words “during each regular annual
session” be stricken out.</p>

<p>That Article V of the Constitution be amended to read as follows:</p>

<p>“Section 4. The President shall appoint a Finance Committee of
five, three from the members of the Executive Committee and two from
the Advisory Board, whose duty it shall be to plan ways and means of
increasing the revenue of the Congress, and to prepare a budget of expenditures.
The Chairman shall be a member of the Executive Committee.</p>

<p>“Section 5. The Executive Committee shall appoint in consultation
with the Vice-President from the State, a State Secretary whose duty
shall be to work with the State organizations for the especial interests of
the Congress. Such Secretary shall report progress to the Executive
Committee.”</p>

<p>That the remaining sections of Article V be renumbered accordingly.</p>

<p>That Section 2 be added to Article VII, to read as follows:</p>

<p>“The membership in the National Conservation Congress shall be as
follows:</p>

<p>“Individual membership, one dollar a year, entitling the member to
a copy of the Proceedings and an invitation to the next year’s Congress,
without further appointment from any organization.</p>

<p>“Individual permanent, or life membership, twenty-five dollars, entitling
the member to a certificate of membership and a copy of the Proceedings
and invitations to all succeeding annual Congresses.</p>

<p>“Individual supporting membership, one hundred dollars, or more,
entitling the member to a certificate of membership, a copy of the Proceedings,
and an invitation to all succeeding Congresses.</p>

<p>“Organization membership, twenty-five dollars, entitling its delegates
to the Proceedings and an invitation to the organization to appoint delegates
to the next Congress.</p>

<p>“Organization supporting membership, one hundred dollars or more,
entitling the organization to appoint one delegate from each State, each
of whom shall receive a copy of the Proceedings.”</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. E. Lee Worsham</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Worsham</span>—We are proposing some radical changes regarding
the membership of the Congress. Heretofore, the personnel of the Congress
has varied from year to year, and we have had no way of keeping
in touch with delegates who attend. We think it is necessary to place
the Congress on a good financial basis, and also to keep in touch with the
people who attend from year to year, and we have, therefore, recommended
these changes. I move the adoption of this report.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span></p>

<p>The motion was seconded, put, and declared carried.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—I will now call for the report of the Nominating
Committee, which will be presented by the Chairman, Prof. George E.
Condra.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Report, Committee on Nominations</span></h3>
<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Condra</span>—Your committee has been working very diligently,
canvassing the situation. We have looked over the field, reviewed the
work of various persons connected with Conservation, noted their efficiency.
We have looked into the future, we have thought of the fitness
of certain individuals for the work, and therefore report as follows:</p>

<p>For President, a man who can take up the work where Captain White
leaves off—Mr. Charles Lathrop Pack, of Cleveland, Ohio. (Great applause.)</p>

<p>For Executive Secretary, one who has been with the work since its
beginning, and has accomplished so much—Mr. Thomas R. Shipp, of Indianapolis.
(Applause.)</p>

<p>For Recording Secretary, one who has also been valuable in the work,
and has been associated with Mr. Pack and with Captain White—Mr.
James C. Gipe, of Indianapolis. (Applause.)</p>

<p>For Treasurer, the man whom the Executive Committee at an earlier
Congress gave an earnest invitation to take up this work, that it might
be taken care of in a manner befitting this Congress—Mr. D. Austin
Latchaw, of Kansas City. (Applause.)</p>

<p>The one who has been nominated for second place, Vice-President, we
named because of fitness to serve all phases of the work of Conservation,
but especially the conservation of life and the home. Not chosen because
she is such a womanly woman; not especially because she has done
splendid work for us here, but chosen because she is a great leader and
we want her for the work. A person known to most of you—Mrs. Philip
N. Moore, of St. Louis. (Applause.)</p>

<p>I do not name the Vice-Presidents of the States, for reasons given in
the report of the Executive Committee. I take great pleasure in moving
the adoption of this report.</p>

<p>The motion was seconded by Mr. A. B. Farquhar, put, and declared
carried.</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">White</span>—I now wish to present to you your next President,
Mr. Charles Lathrop Pack. (Applause.)</p>

<p>It is with great pleasure that I present to you the President of the
next Congress. He is one who is thoroughly in love with Conservation.
He is one of those who first studied Conservation. He spent years in
its study, and he is, I know, the first American who ever received a fee
for scientific forestry advice. He was paid one thousand dollars by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
President of the Missouri Pacific Road for his expert opinion. When
Mr. Pack returned from Germany, where he had been studying forestry
for some time, he was sent for by Jay Gould, who asked him for his
expert opinion on some forestry matters. Next morning Mr. Pack found
in his box at the hotel a check for $1,000. This was the earliest record
of such a fee being paid in the United States. So, if he was appreciated
to this extent by a great railroad president then, we surely can trust him
now. We are proud to have him as our President, and we feel he will
be a great help to Conservation in the ensuing year. Mr. Charles Lathrop
Pack, your new President, will now take the chair. (Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. Charles Lathrop Pack</span></h3>
<p>President <span class="smcap">Pack</span>—Ladies and Gentlemen: You have a great work
before you, not only for the ensuing year, but for all years. The Conservation
movement is not one for today, but for all time, and it matters
very little the name or the names of the workers in the cause. It
matters that you, and every one of you, should have your hearts right
and do the right work. Conservation makes for the best use of all
resources, and is dead against their abuse. It is your duty and my
duty not only to come to these Congresses and confer and talk, but when
you go home to be a true advocate of the cause and to be against everything
that is opposed to it. (Applause.) Conservation is for men and
women, and for one I thank God we have the women with us. (Applause.)</p>

<p>I do not intend to make a speech; I am not a speech-maker. You
have plenty of orators. But with your help during the next year, I will
try to do my part, and I ask every one of you to go to your homes and
come back to the next Conservation Congress with three delegates in
place of one. I thank you. (Applause.)</p>

<p>Before we go any farther, I ask you to rise and join me in giving
three cheers for that great Conservationist, Captain White.</p>

<p>Three rousing cheers were given, led by Mr. Pack.</p>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">White</span>—Ladies and Gentlemen, Delegates to the Congress, Mr.
President: This is glory enough for me. I feel paid for the work I
have done in the past year in having the appreciation of such a good
class of people. (Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">Pack</span>—The next speaker on the program is Mr. George M.
Lehman, representing the Mayor of Pittsburgh, who will speak to us on
“The Investigations of the Flood Commission of Pittsburgh.”</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Investigations of Flood Commission of Pittsburg”</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lehman</span>—Mr. Chairman and Delegates of the Fourth National
Conservation Congress: It has been the custom in this country to build
dams and locks on lower reaches of rivers, for navigation; to build regulating
works for forming and maintaining channel depth, etc., and to
dredge deposits caused by erosion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>Our country has received large benefit from this process, particularly
in certain sections. It would have thrived, however, to a far greater
extent and much suffering, involving general living and business conditions,
would have been avoided and a better foundation provided for
future generations, if, in addition to the above-named developments, attention
had been promptly and thoroughly given to the control and
conservation of flood water. We have been woefully thoughtless and
backward in bringing about a comprehensive treatment of this matter
which is of such great national importance.</p>


<p class="center">HISTORICAL AND GENERAL OUTLINE OF WORK.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh having been seriously troubled by destructive floods for
over a century, attention was finally directed toward means of alleviation
and in 1908 the Chamber of Commerce organized a commission consisting
of business men, engineers and other professional men, to ascertain the
character and extent of flood damage and make investigations of methods
for relief. Later, an enlargement of the commission was made by the
addition of city and county officials and representatives of manufacturing
and various business concerns affected by floods. The expense of
carrying on the work has been borne by public-spirited citizens, including
the interests affected by the floods, and by county and city contributions.
To this date about $137,000 has been expended.</p>

<p>The work has involved detailed surveys and soundings, within the
city limits, of the Ohio, Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers, and a survey
of the areas of overflow. The topography was fully developed, and
streets, lines of transportation, buildings, etc., located. Extensive
topographic surveys were made along the principal tributaries of the
Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers for the purpose of determining the
possibility of constructing storage reservoirs.</p>

<p>In connection with complete contour maps, diagrams, profiles, etc.,
made from the above work, studies have been made of the cost and
effectiveness of a flood wall, in connection with dredging, in deepening,
widening and straightening of the river channel at the city, and the
cost and effectiveness of regulating the stream flow by storage reservoirs,
located throughout the drainage basins. In addition to the collection
of a vast amount of general data, including precipitation, taken from the
records of the United States Weather Bureau, the work involved many
special studies, among which were forest conditions, geology and stream-flow.
For the stream-flow studies, gauging stations were established by
the Flood Commission and also a number in co-operation with the Water
Supply Commission of Pennsylvania. In the forest studies, the co-operation
of the United States Forest Service and of the Forestry Department
of Pennsylvania were secured. Valuable stream-flow data
have been provided by the United States Geological Survey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>At the beginning of the investigations the matter was treated as of
local concern only, but as the work progressed the broad aspect of the
problem and its national scope were realized, as it became evident that
Pittsburgh’s floods had a direct bearing upon the flood troubles of other
communities. Further study disclosed the fact that inseparable from
the flood problem was the question of navigation, sanitation, water supply
and water power, and that the valleys of the Allegheny, Monongahela
and Ohio Rivers could be benefited wherever conditions are favorable for
the construction of storage reservoirs. On many of the principal tributaries
of the Ohio below Pittsburgh, the topography is favorable for
storage reservoirs upon a large scale, and floods could be prevented
throughout the Ohio valley by extending the plans of the Flood Commission.</p>

<p>An exhaustive report, consisting mostly of original data, has been
published by the Commission, as the result of nearly four years of painstaking
work. It is said that this report forms the most comprehensive
treatment of a subject of this kind that has ever been carried out. The
report contains over 900 pages, including numerous maps and diagrams,
and a large number of illustrations, showing flood damage, reservoir
sites, forest conditions, etc.</p>


<p class="center">FLOOD DAMAGE.</p>

<p>Pittsburgh, which has a population of 533,905, and about twice as
much with the contemplated greater city, is located at the head of the
Ohio River and at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela
Rivers. The combined drainage area, above the city, amounts to 18,920
square miles. Of the two rivers, 150 miles, directly connecting with the
city, have been slackwatered. About 14,000 miles of navigable waterway
lies below the city. The National Government, in a few years’ time, will
have the entire 967 miles of the Ohio River improved.</p>

<p>The tonnage of Pittsburgh, incoming and outgoing, amounted in 1910
to 167,000,000 tons, of which 11,000,000 tons consisted of river traffic.
The above total tonnage, which has doubled in the last six years, is
twice as great as the combined tonnage of New York, London, Hamburg
and Marseilles.</p>

<p>As is frequently the case in communities situated upon the inland
rivers of this country, the most important commercial and industrial
parts of Pittsburgh are located upon the low lying areas bordering the
water. The need of free access to water and of rail and water transportation
naturally brings about such development. In fact, on account
of the topography, rail communication can in many cases be satisfactorily
established only along the stream. Such a condition, however, frequently
causes great suffering and interruption to business, involving not
only the districts in direct touch with the river, but the whole community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span></p>

<p>During the progress of the investigations, it became evident that
unless some adequate method of flood relief could be devised and carried
out, the larger portion of the flood affected areas could never be properly
developed, and the capital invested therein would continue to suffer.
The general needs of building operations and of city improvements will
of necessity keep pace with the advance of population; and the flood
damages, which in their effect involve the home conditions and business
life of the entire city and surrounding communities, will become correspondingly
greater.</p>

<p>In ascertaining the extent of flood damage to the city, a careful investigation
was made of three floods which occurred within a period
of about twelve months, from March 15, 1907, to March 20, 1908. In
the conduct of this work it was noted that while those coming in direct
contact with the floods are alert to the seriousness of the situation during
the flood, the matter is, however, after a time almost forgotten; the
disposition in most cases apparently being to take the troubles as they
come rather than to do anything in the way of even attempting to devise
means of relief.</p>

<p>The classification under which this work was done, and the monetary
amount of direct losses within the city by the three floods may be given
as follows:</p>

<table class="autotable fs80">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">Damage to buildings, equipment and machinery</td>
<td class="tdr">$782,400</td>

<tr>
<td class="tdc">Total</td>
<td class="tdr">$6,514,000</td>
</tr>
</table>


<p>It was found that the loss ranges as follows: For the flood of 27.3
feet, $414,700; 30.7 feet, $839,800; 35.5 feet, $5,259,500.</p>

<p>The area comprising the larger part of the mercantile, industrial and
railroad interests amounts to about 3,000 acres, 1,540 of which was covered
by water during the great flood of 1907, which had a height of 35.5
feet, or 13.5 feet above the danger line. This flood remained sixty-five
hours above the danger line of 22 feet. About fifteen miles of river
front land are occupied with industrial works of various kinds. The
assessed value of real estate as affected by the 1907 flood amounts to
about $160,000,000, and a careful estimate shows that this property is
nearly $50,000,000 lower in value than it would be if protected from
floods. Using the results obtained for the above floods and the flood
records for the past twenty years it is estimated that the direct loss to
the city has amounted in that period to about $17,000,000, over $12,000,000
of which occurred in the ten years preceding January, 1911.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>Based on the assumption that in the next two ten-year periods there
will be no increase in number or height of floods over those occurring in
the ten years just preceding January, 1911, it is estimated, if protective
measures are not provided, that the flood losses at Pittsburgh in the
next twenty years will amount to about $25,000,000. As records show,
however, that floods are increasing in frequency and height, it is estimated
that the losses in the next twenty years will amount to about
$40,000,000, or nearly twice as much as it will cost to carry out the
flood prevention measures recommended by the Commission.</p>

<p>The Commission did not have resources for securing the amount of
damage at the many important points along the rivers, above and below
Pittsburgh, but at Wheeling, W. Va., it was ascertained, for instance,
that about $1,000,000 was lost during the flood of 1907. Authorities
consider that the total loss along the Ohio Valley for the two floods of
1907 amounted to more than $100,000,000. This is indicative of the
vast losses occurring annually all over the country.</p>

<p>In addition to many miles of street car tracks, streets and alleys,
about 435 acres of railroad and industrial yards were covered, in addition
to 17 miles of main railroad, by the big flood of 1907.</p>

<p>At high stages many manufacturing plants must close down. The
following is quoted from a report of the American Iron and Steel Association:
“Damage to the iron and steel industry unprecedented. At
beginning of March, 1907, flood there were forty-four blast furnaces in
Allegheny County in blast, and of these thirty-eight had to be banked
for an average of two days. Work at most of the sixty-five or seventy
rolling mills and steel works was suspended.” Many of the open-hearth
furnaces were badly damaged and some of them practically ruined.</p>


<p class="center">FLOOD PROTECTION.</p>

<p>Regarding methods of local treatment, studies and estimates of cost
were made of the following: A wall of about twenty-five miles in length
to be built in the city along the river fronts; also for deepening, widening
and straightening of the river channel by dredging.</p>

<p>The wall, high in places above the river streets, would prevent overflow
by confining the floods to the channel. Dredging and removal of
obstacles in the channel, bank encroachments, etc., as can now be accomplished,
would have comparatively slight effect in reducing flood heights
and these means were, therefore, not broadly recommended. Furthermore,
these forms of treatment would be of local flood benefit only and
communities above and below Pittsburgh would continue to suffer in
various ways.</p>

<p>A wall of limited height, however, is really desirable, at least along
certain parts of the river. While reservoir control would result in reclaiming
considerable areas of land, a wall would provide means for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
adding to the amount and greatly improve the appearance and usefulness
of the banks. The handling of cargoes, to and from river boats
would be greatly facilitated by means of modern devices. Sheds could
be constructed along the wall and close to the boats which would lie
alongside. Such arrangement would make feasible the bringing directly
of river and rail transportation with the great advantage of through
rates and routes, a condition which is now lacking at practically all
points on American rivers.</p>


<p class="center">FLOOD PREVENTION.</p>

<p>In the treatment of the flood problem, prevention, by the use of
storage reservoirs, for the purpose of holding back the damaging part of
the flood water, is the rational and comprehensive method, as it goes to
the source of the trouble, and extends its benefits throughout the entire
river valleys, not only in the form of flood relief, but by improvement
of the low-water flow, due to the release of the impounded flood waters
during the dry season.</p>

<p>Forest cover is beneficial to some extent in retarding the run-off and
in improvement of low-water flow, and the attitude of the Flood Commission
is to support such National and State legislation as will tend to
preserve and increase the present forest cover. The Commission, however,
recommends the use of the storage reservoir system, supplemented
by other means where necessary, for the reason that such a system could
be speedily brought about. The use of storage reservoirs for flood control
is not a new idea in this country and this method is now successfully
employed in European countries.</p>

<p>The exhaustive surveys and studies for flood prevention disclosed the
fact that forty-three reservoir sites are available in the Allegheny and
Monongahela drainage basins above Pittsburgh, and that while not
needed for present purposes additional sites are feasible. The forty-three
projects would have a total capacity of 80,500,000,000 cubic feet,
would cost $34,000,000, and would control about sixty-two per cent. of
the total drainage area above the city. After a careful analysis it was
found that a less number of reservoirs was practically as effective, under
proper manipulation, and a selection was made of the most favorable
ones, seventeen in number. These would have a total capacity of 59,500,000,000
cubic feet, would cost $21,700,000, or about $364 per million
cubic feet of storage capacity, and would control fifty-four per cent. of
the total drainage area.</p>

<p>As a basis, eleven of the principal floods, occurring within recent
years, were exhaustively studied and it was found that the seventeen
selected reservoir projects would reduce all of them, with one exception,
to below danger line. Investigation showed that a low wall built at
comparatively small cost along a few parts of the low-lying river fronts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
could be used in combination with the seventeen reservoirs to prevent
overflow by the highest known floods. This combination was therefore
recommended, the total cost being estimated at $22,350,000.</p>

<p>Some of the benefits to be derived by preventative methods and
stream regulation and development, may be summarized as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. Reducing or doing away with floods and flood damages and
their constant menace, thereby encouraging and making possible
for present and future generations full development of affected
areas.</p>

<p>2. (a) Improving of navigation, by permanently increased
stream-flow in slackwatered rivers, where dry weather flow is frequently
inadequate to furnish desired draft, thus providing uninterrupted
transportation not only for present business but for
future demands. (If the reservoirs were brought up to maximum
capacity, that is, above flood control requirements, the low-water
flow of the Ohio, at Wheeling, ninety miles below Pittsburgh,
would be nearly six times the present minimum, giving an increase
in stage of 3.7 feet. One of the largest floods would have been
reduced over thirteen feet.)</p>

<p>(b) Making possible slack water on certain rivers, worthy of
attention, but now unimproved largely on account of absolute lack
of sufficient water.</p>

<p>(c) Reducing velocity of current, due to lowering of high
stages, thereby making safer the maneuvering of river craft;
reducing wide fluctuations in water levels, particularly at river
ports, facilitating thereby the handling of cargoes and increasing
clearance under bridges. (Under a certain bridge at Pittsburgh,
investigations show that during the past fifty-three years there
has been an average of fifty-seven days when the ordinary steamboat
could not pass. Had the proposed system of reservoirs been
in operation the water would have been lowered so that there would
have been an average of only three days.)</p>

<p>(d) By having the great fluctuations reduced, the erosion of
the banks along the bottom lands and at other places would naturally
be considerably lessened.</p>

<p>3. Improving sanitary conditions and increasing the quality
and quantity of the supply for municipal and industrial purposes.
High stages leave deposits on banks, becoming a nuisance to
health; and low stages are frequently unable to properly carry
away polluted water stagnating in slack water or natural pools.</p>

<p>4. Developing water power, which is feasible under favorable
conditions in connection with reservoir systems for flood prevention.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>

<p>I would call attention to the fact that this brief review upon stream
regulation goes far enough to show that so far as damage from floods is
concerned alone, the matter is not only of local but of great National concern,
affecting as it does railroads and manufacturing interests which
supply the Nation. What is true of Pittsburgh is also true of many
other river localities, and it is therefore urged that the question be
looked at in a progressive manner and that suitable State and National
legislation be enacted at the earliest possible moment to provide not only
for full navigation requirements, but in addition for flood damage and
the combination of needs as outlined in the report of the Flood Commission.
It is hoped that this Congress will lend its powerful co-operation
in bringing about the accomplishment of this great movement
which is so necessary to the public welfare. (Applause.)</p>


<p>President <span class="smcap">Pack</span>—I am sure we are all indebted for this paper, and to
Mr. Lehman for coming from Pittsburgh to present this valuable subject.</p>

<p>If there is nothing more before the Congress at this time we will
adjourn until 2:00 o’clock.</p>

<p>The Congress was called to order by Mr. J. B. White, in the Murat
Theater, Indianapolis, at 2:30 o’clock p. m.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Hon. J. B. White</span></h3>
<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">White</span>—It is long past the time for our meeting, but we
have not had the last word from Governor Hadley. He wired me night
before last of an accident, and that his physician said it would not do
for him to come yesterday. Last night we had another telegram, saying
he was afraid he could not come, and that we had better not depend on
him. I also received a letter. Then I wired him again, but have no
reply, so it is barely possible that he will be here in time to speak to us
this afternoon. The committee has gone down to meet the 2:50 train.
In his letter, he says:</p>

<p>“I want to thank you again for your kindness in giving me such a
prominent place upon your program, and were it not for the fact that I
know your meeting will be a complete success with Governor Wilson
alone, it would be an added regret—my inability to be present.”</p>

<p>I know many of you came expecting to hear Governor Hadley, and
he certainly will give us a splendid address if he comes. He appointed
a commission in the State of Missouri, of which I have the honor of being
a member, and we have had meetings at the Governor’s mansion, and we
are trying to induce the Legislature of Missouri to pass a good law in
favor of Conservation of all natural resources. I cannot report as to our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
progress as I would like, so I will not say anything about what we have
done. We know what we are trying to do.</p>

<p>The newly elected President is not here, and he insists that I take his
place until he comes. We will now listen to “The Story of the Soil,”
from one who has given it great thought and attention. He has brought
about good results that will be of benefit to the farmer and to every one
who lives in the country, and therefore of benefit to all the citizens of
our common country. I have pleasure in presenting Mr. H. H. Gross,
President of the National Soil Fertility League, who will speak on “The
Story of the Soil.” (Applause.)</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Story of the Soil”</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gross</span>—Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am here representing
what we think is one of the most distinguished organizations of
this country—one devoted to a specific and definite purpose, and that is
to secure the application upon our farms of the best methods of farm
practices.</p>

<p>In our self-sufficiency we are sometimes disposed to pooh-pooh science.
I have heard farmers say, “What do I care about science? I know
how to farm. I am a practical farmer.” When I hear a man talk
about being a practical farmer, or a practical shoemaker or anything
else, I begin to question his knowledge of the art. Reduced to its last
analysis, science is simply applied common sense. In other words, to
find out the best way of doing anything and then doing it that way.</p>

<p>Scientific farming will increase the output per man, per plow, per
mule, per acre, and at the same time it will build up the fertility of the
soil. Unscientific methods will wear it out. Millions upon millions of
acres of land have been wasted by practical farmers in unscientific farming,
by abuse and misuse until the land fails to yield enough to pay the
labor of cultivating them. There are millions of acres east of Albany
that are not worth today one-fourth as much as they were one hundred
years ago.</p>

<p>The soil is our greatest natural asset. It is God’s best gift to man
outside of Him who came to save us. It is our duty to conserve this
gift as a priceless heritage. In a higher sense the man in whose name
the title stands is not the real owner of the land; it is his to use during
his lifetime and to pass it on to his successor. It is his paramount duty
to turn it over to those that follow him as useful as when he received it.
The land is not his except to use, it is not his to abuse. The fertile
fields were placed here by God Almighty for the use of humanity for all
time and no one has the right to rob the soil of its power to produce and
thereby imperil or destroy the birthright of succeeding generations.</p>

<p>Let us look at Europe. They produce two or three times as much as
we do upon the same area, notwithstanding their lands have been a
thousand years longer under the plow than our own. There must be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
reason, and it is that Europe, because of its large population, has been
compelled to adopt intensive farming or go hungry. With us it has
been different up to the present time. A few years ago, some of we
older men can remember the time, when the United States invited everybody
to come in and possess the land. An old song says, “Uncle Sam is
rich enough to give us all a farm.” Since then our population has
increased faster than the farming industry. We are now consuming
ninety per cent. of our wheat and ninety-eight per cent. of our corn.
The population is rapidly overtaking production. In fifty years our
population will be doubled. What shall we do about it? I say to you
this, we must do better farming or the people will go hungry. A thousand
years or so ago Japan and India were at the parting of the ways—about
where we stand today. Japan chose the better part and conserved
the fertility of her soil and by intensive scientific culture she has fed
her people and has demonstrated that a very small patch of ground
indeed is sufficient to support an individual. This has been shown in
this country—that one or two acres, properly handled, will take care of
a small family. Japan acted wisely and is rich and prosperous today.
India neglected her duties and her opportunity and today there are
millions starving there on account of the lack of foresight of those people
who lived thousands of years ago. Shall we follow Japan or India?
There can be but one answer. The intelligence of the American people,
the spirit of the age demands that we go forward to attain the highest
and best and it is our duty to help to this end.</p>

<p>Denmark, a generation or two ago, was in poverty and distress, its
people were crowding into the cities. The government saw something
must be done to improve conditions. It wisely decided that agriculture
must be encouraged, so it commenced to teach agriculture in the schools.
It had its agricultural colleges strengthened, it sent men out among the
people as traveling schoolmasters, visiting one community after another.
Agriculture was taught in the schools. This helped some, but did not
solve the problem. Finally they adopted the plan which we propose to
follow, of sending a trained farm demonstrator into every community
and stay there, study local conditions, meet the farmers right on the
soil, and help them to understand and apply the best methods and get
the best results for the time and effort expended. In two generations
it brought Denmark from poverty to thrift, and today it is the finest
agricultural country in the world. This comes about from carrying the
knowledge to the farm home in the personality of the farm demonstrator
who helps the farmer apply the best methods in practice.</p>

<p>Wherever the plan has been tried it has succeeded. It is the one
plan that has made good, and in my judgment it is the only one that ever
will. Now, then, what are we going to do about it? The most important
question that has been discussed on this platform during this Congress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
is the one under discussion now. It is vital, it touches every human
interest. The question is, shall we build up our soil and insure the food
supply for coming generations, or shall we not? It is a tremendously
important question and one pressing for answer.</p>

<p>I am glad to say this to you, that the National Soil Fertility League
determined upon a plan, and so far we have had greater success in carrying
it forward than we had any reason to expect. Its plan has the
approval of nearly every agricultural authority in the land. It
awakened a tremendous amount of interest. It shows many people were
thinking in a general way that something ought to be done and were
ready to rally to the support of any definite proposition that commended
itself to their judgment. The National Soil Fertility League, together
with the agricultural college men, drafted what is known as the Lever
bill, the object of which is to provide for the co-operation of the Federal
Government and the several States in carrying forward this farm demonstration
plan. Under this bill the Federal Government makes an
annual appropriation to every State of $10,000 a year, irrespective of
condition; then it makes further appropriations conditioned upon the
States furnishing an equal sum beginning with $300,000 and increasing
to $3,000,000 in ten years. Except for the $10,000 all the appropriations
are prorated among the States on the basis of rural population. Indiana
under this plan would get $10,000 right off the reel from the fixed appropriation;
it would get $9,400 from the conditional appropriation provided
Indiana should furnish an equal sum. So Indiana would get
from the Federal Government the first year a total of $19,400. This
would go to Purdue University. Next year it would be increased to
$28,800 and would go on up to $104,000 from the general government to
the State College of Agriculture. In order to get this money Indiana
would have to raise $94,000, so that the State would have when the maximum
was reached approximately $200,000 to expend for carrying to the
farmers of Indiana the existing methods of agriculture and carrying to
the farmer’s wife the best they can give her. What a wonderful help
this would be.</p>

<p>There are three great needs in the open country. One is better
schools. The country schools of today are not worthy of their name.
They fail to meet the requirements of the day and generation. The next
important need is good roads, and the third is scientific agriculture.
Bringing these improvements about will revolutionize conditions. It will
raise agriculture to the first place and the highest place in the estimation
of the people. It will be the strongest possible magnet to hold the girl
and the boy to the farm home. It will make agriculture more pleasant,
more profitable and in every way a more desirable vocation.</p>

<p>When I was a boy and went away to school, I entered a class of boys
and we were lined up before the principal and each was asked his name<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
and his father’s business; one would answer his father was a banker,
another a merchant, another a doctor, a manufacturer, and so on. When
it came to me, I said a farmer. The boys all laughed and I was obliged
to take it. I licked two or three of them afterward to get my standing
on the campus.</p>

<p>We used to think that anybody could run a farm. A story is told
of a man who had three sons. One was very smart, one was exceedingly
good and one was simple-minded. The father said: “Tom is smart as
chain lightning; I am going to make a lawyer of Tom. William is
about the best boy I ever knew; you can’t get him to go wrong; I am
going to make a preacher of him. But Jack don’t seem to know much
of anything, and I will make a farmer of Jack.” (Laughter.)</p>

<p>Let me say to you with all possible emphasis that it takes as much
ability to run a farm well as it does to run a bank or a factory, and
much more than it does to run for office. (Laughter.)</p>

<p>When the Lever bill was introduced in Congress, it passed the committee
and was placed on the calendar and was buried there. The question
was to get that bill on the floor for a vote. Upon inquiry I found
there was only one way to do it in order to get quick action, and that
was to get a petition signed by a majority of the members, asking that
the bill be taken from its position on the calendar and placed at the
head of the list as unfinished business. Mr. Lever secured the required
signatures and the bill was thus advanced to the position of unfinished
business. The leaders of both parties rallied to its support and the bill
finally passed the House by unanimous vote. It is now before the
Senate and we want your help to get it enacted into law before the
holiday season arrives.</p>

<p>The mind can hardly grasp the benefits that will flow from this legislation.
Let me tell you a little of what scientific farming means. Dr.
Hopkins, of the University of Illinois, and one of the world’s authorities,
just told me that they raised on an average ninety bushels of corn
to the acre, covering a period of six years, and twenty-three bushels of
wheat, average for six years. The Ohio experiment station on wheat for
twenty years showed an average of about thirty-five bushels, while the
average for the whole country was less than fifteen bushels. Denmark
raises forty bushels average, many fields returning sixty and seventy-five
bushels to the acre. We must do better farming.</p>

<p>During the ten years from 1900 to 1910 our population increased
twenty-one per cent., our meat supplying animals decreased more than
twenty-five per cent. We have an unparalleled high cost of living, due
to the fact that population is pressing hard upon production. In short,
we have too few producers and too many consumers. Increased production
is not the only thing necessary. It is quite as important that
the farm production shall reach the ultimate consumer from the farm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
at less than the present cost. Our marketing system is cumbersome,
unwieldy, wasteful and burdensome. (Applause.) The woman who
orders her supplies over the telephone pays more money and gets less
than the one who goes to market. I had the honor of speaking before
the National Federation of Women’s Clubs at San Francisco on the first
day of July. It was the greatest and most intelligent audience I ever
faced. They were very enthusiastic and were quick to grasp the points
as they were made. This great organization affiliated itself with the
National Soil Fertility League, and when they did so we felt it brought
to us the greatest assistance that could possibly come. I know of no
organization of wider influence than the Women’s Clubs of America. I
have heard it said, if you want to get anything done to get a woman
after it. (Applause.)</p>

<p>We must re-direct our agriculture; we must raise our meat upon the
farms. The ranges are gone. The silo, alfalfa and scientific methods
make it possible for the farmer to carry at least twice as much stock
upon his farm as he thinks he can carry. In the silo the feed is kept
practically green and juicy. You get forty per cent. more out of your
corn by putting it through the silo than by handling it in the old way.
There is no reason why the cost of producing meat may not be reduced
practically one-half. The farmer has given and is giving too much
thought to how much he can get for what he raises. It is equally important
that he raise more. If he wants 2,400 bushels of corn, it is better
to raise it on forty acres with a yield of sixty bushels than to raise it
on sixty acres with a yield of forty bushels.</p>

<p>Our plan is to bring home to the farmer the best method that has
been determined by the agricultural college and experiment station. We
want to get the best results from year to year and at the same time
build up the soil. This can be done and this is scientific farming. This
is what the whole world needs. The colleges of agriculture and experiment
stations have gathered a vast fund of knowledge, and if this were
put into practical operation it would double the yield of our farms
within a few years and give us a large surplus for export and bring
money into the country. We would get richer and richer as the years
go by. We would largely supply the world with food. Our position in
the councils of nations would be paramount. When it comes to the
question of peace or war, the country that has the money and the bread
basket is ten times more potent than the nation that only has back of it
battleships and armies. (Applause.) So I wish to emphasize that the
success of this country rests primarily upon the scientific farming of
our fields. Let us remember that no country ever became great and
remained so that could not furnish its people with an ample food supply
at a moderate cost. To that end we are securing legislation that will
put the plan in operation. The Lever measure is a simple one, it creates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</span>
no new administrative machinery; it simply carries to the farmer and
puts to work the information and knowledge that the States and Federal
Government have been gathering for fifty years. This whole matter may
be likened to a great irrigating system. The United States Department
of Agriculture is a dam, it has been gathering and has stored up the
knowledge—the water. The colleges of agriculture are the main channels
for reaching the various parts of the country; but so long as the
water is back of the dam it is doing no good; so long as it remains in
the main channels it is accomplishing nothing. What is needed is to
get the water to the grass roots, or, in other words, our purpose is to get
the information to the actual farmer—the man behind the plow.</p>

<p>Fifty years ago Horace Greeley said, “Go West, young man, and
grow up with the country.” If he were here today he would say go
South and East, for that is the land of opportunity. In my judgment
this Congress ought to meet next year somewhere in the South. That
part of the land is entitled to recognition, and you will get a welcome
such as you never had before.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to urge that you give us every possible support.
We need it. It will help you and it will help us. Let us all work together
for reviving agriculture. (Applause.)</p>


<p>(A woman in the audience): “Is it true that Congress is investigating
this silo business and under the pure food law is it to be condemned?
Also, what must we do in Indiana to cultivate alfalfa?”</p>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Gross</span>—I have not heard anything about the Federal Government
condemning silo, and I do not expect to. Inoculate your soil for alfalfa.
You had better take this matter up with your people at Purdue. Ask
them what to do. They will send you all the information necessary.
They will examine into conditions and tell you just what to do. The
most valuable crop today, outside of wheat and corn, is alfalfa. (Applause.)</p>


<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">White</span>—I have been handed a communication, and I wish
to say for the benefit of the gentleman who sent it to the chair that it
will be referred to the Executive Committee, which takes up matters of
this kind. This is the communication:</p>

<p>“You are requested to make a motion that this organization take
steps toward publishing a monthly, or quarterly, magazine, to be known
as the National Conservation Magazine. If the society is unable to
finance it, there is little doubt that the Carnegie Institute or the Sage
Foundation would back it.”</p>


<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">White</span>—I will now introduce a gentleman who will tell
you “The Story of the Air,” Prof. Willis L. Moore, of Washington,
Chief of the United States Weather Bureau. (Applause.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span></p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Story of the Air”</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Moore</span>—Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have been
trying to reason out why the management put me at the end of the
program, and I have concluded that they had an idea that along about
this time in the proceedings they would need to have some one take the
platform that had supervision over atmospheric air of abnormal temperature.</p>

<p>Now, why should one wish to conserve the atmosphere? I shall try to
show you that that is one of the assets of this continent, and, I am afraid,
almost the only one, that cannot be monopolized. (Applause.) And
you will be surprised, and probably doubt my statement when I say
that, with all due respect to the matter of conservation of our wonderful
mineral deposits, the controlling of the flow of our streams, the preservation
of our great forests—all of them important—we have in the atmosphere
one of our greatest assets, if not the greatest asset of our
continent. Humboldt has said that “Man is a product of soil and
climate. He is brother to the trees, the rock and the animals.” All
true, but still I would slightly modify that and say that man is largely
a product of climate. For it is the action of rainfall, flood and temperature
changes that makes soil.</p>

<p>I shall try to show you that it is climatic conditions that produce
this wonderful, this powerful, this resourceful composite man called the
American.</p>

<p>I am to speak on “The Story of the Air,” but before I elucidate
any further, let me give you a little picture of this wonderful ocean, on
the bottom of which you live.</p>

<p>In the turbulent stratum in which we live we have vortices in the
atmosphere which cause weather. Weather is the result of the motions
of air; it is the result of the dynamic heating and cooling of ascending
and descending currents of air. If it were not for these vortices cooling
the air and heating it, you would have precisely the same temperature
on any day of one year as you would have on the same day in another
year. You would not have one first day of June warmer than the
first day of July, or the first day of December colder than the first day
of January.</p>

<p>To demonstrate my first proposition that we have a great asset in the
climate of the United States, I call your attention to some of the conditions
in Europe. Their great mountain ranges trend east and west;
ours trend north and south. Cyclonic storms originate largely from
conflict of equatorial and polar currents coming together. The currents
of air come together in the lower stratum. In Europe the great mountain
ranges prevent that conflict; but not so here, with our mountain ranges
running north and south. Here is the great meteorological theater of
the world, the region of conflict. What is the result? A people powerful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
physically and resourceful mentally. An actual air is pure and invigorating.</p>

<p>Now, I just have a thought that may not be germane, but it is upon
my mind. I remember some years ago I wrote a report that dealt with
the relations of forests and floods. Although from the inception of this
movement I have been heart and soul with the people back of it, still
because I do not agree with some of my friends on forestry, on the effect
of forests on the flow of streams, I was classified as an enemy of the cause.
I wish to say that it is a mistake to bring a fallacious reasoning to any
good doctrine. I believe it is a positive injury to attempt to sustain
truth by falsehood. I do not mean that anybody is wilfully untruthful—no,
simply mistaken. There are so many reasons why we should conserve
and protect, why we should use wisely our great forest areas, that
there is no need to bring to the support of that great project anything
like a reason that can be successfully attacked and refuted. I am satisfied,
and as time goes on and other investigators come along and go over
my data, I am thoroughly well convinced that the forests do not exert a
great controlling influence over floods. I am satisfied that the percentage
of floods has not increased for the past forty years. When we remove
one vegetable covering like the forests, if we go on and plant
wheat, or corn, or grass, we simply exchange one form of vegetable covering
for another. If we cut the forests away and leave them, they will
at once begin the process of reforestation, and within a few weeks the
ground is shaded. If you grub out the roots and stumps and plow, you
change one form of vegetable covering for another, and the history of the
United States, as well as of the world, does not bear out the statement
that the floods have increased with the disappearing of the forests; nor
has it been shown that any part of the world has been materially changed
in its climatic conditions as a result of civilization or the coming of man.
But that is no reason why the forests should not be protected and a wise
use made of them.</p>

<p>Let us get down to facts. Just so long as the Gulf of Mexico lies
down there on the south, and the great Atlantic remains on the east,
just so long rainfall in the United States will be as voluminous on the
great cereal plains as it was when the first white man set foot on the
continent, and in its movement back to the sea the permeable, cultivated
soil of the unforested acres will doubtless as well conserve and restrict
its flow as the forests. We have over-estimated the effect of the little
scratchings upon the earth’s surface by the activities of man. The coming
civilization of the great West is immaterial in causing an increase in
rainfall. When you stop to consider the enormous volume of the atmosphere
above the surface, whose vaporous contents must be materially
changed and the thermal conditions altered before you can detract from
the rainfall, you will realize how absurd are some popular theories. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
do not agree. I radically differ from some of my contemporaries in the
Department of Agriculture—but people may differ and still be friends.
They may differ in regard to the details of a great movement and still
not be inimical to its best interests. The man who differs and brings
forth the truth is the best friend of the movement, because nothing can
stand long that is not predicated on truth.</p>

<p>I am glad to see that in this movement your managers have brought
together so many independent lines of human activity. This great movement
is only at its inception. I predict that this Conservation Congress
will be one of the most potent factors in the Nation for the developing
and awakening of the people. You are willing now to have a free
forum, to have free discussion by those of differing opinions. And at
this time, Mr. President, when there is such great conflict among the
forces that make for civilization, we must not only protect ourselves
morally and mentally, we must with equal earnestness attempt to conserve
and protect the human individual. He is the greatest asset we
can have, after all. (Applause.)</p>

<p>A fair wage scale and reasonable hours of labor have done as much
to elevate the American citizen and furnish the ties that bind him to
home and State as have all the libraries and universities in the land,
and I say this without any disparagement of these magnificent institutions
for public good. But if you stop to think for a moment, the library
can only be used by those who have a reasonable leisure to enjoy it;
colleges have closed doors for those who do not receive something more
than a living wage. The welfare of this Nation depends not on the
accumulation of great wealth in the future; not upon the palaces on
Fifth avenue or the villas at Newport. It depends upon the cultivation—upon
the high average intelligence and prosperity of those who actually
do the Nation’s work, whether they labor with brains or with brawn.
(Applause.) And right here let me say to you people who are considering
these great problems, that we want brawn developed by working
hours that shall not warp and distort the image of God; and we want
technical and scientific teaching that shall be as free to the sons and
daughters of those who work as to these who have their way paid to
college. (Applause.) We must lift from the bottom in any great movement;
no movement gets very far that is worked from the top down.</p>

<p>So I am glad to see this movement bringing into its counsels those who
are affiliated with the great labor movements of organized labor. My
sympathies go out to the man who works with his hands, as well as to
the man who works with his brain. I thank you. (Applause.)</p>


<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">White</span>—Professor Moore stated he did not know why he
was put down at the last end of the program. Perhaps it is not necessary
to remind him that there is an old saying that the best of the wine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
is reserved for the last of the feast. (Applause.) But where all is
good, and where all is best, as has been the case with the program of this
Fourth National Conservation Congress, there can be no choice. And
again I am going to remind this audience that this Congress is going to
prepare a book containing every bit of the proceedings of this meeting,
and it will be one of the best publications of proceedings that has been
presented by any congress in the land, and I want to impress upon you,
delegates and visitors alike, to leave a dollar for a copy of these proceedings.</p>

<p>While we are waiting for a final word from Governor Hadley, I will
call upon Mr. Walter H. Page, Chairman of the Committee on Resolutions,
who will present the report of that committee, which I hope will
be enthusiastically adopted.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Report, Committee on Resolutions</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Page read the resolutions (which will be found in full at the
beginning of this volume), and moved their adoption.</p>

<p>The motion was seconded, put and carried.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Resolution, Mr. John B. Hammond</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">John B. Hammond</span> (Des Moines, Iowa)—I have a resolution to
present. It was referred to the Resolutions Committee, but somehow
it was lost in the shuffle.</p>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Page</span>—It was referred to one of the sub-committees, and, presumably,
was not accepted by the sub-committee. It was not reported
to the full committee.</p>


<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">White</span>—If there is no objection, it may be presented to
this body.</p>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hammond</span>—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Whereas, The protection of womanhood and childhood is the heart and
center of the Conservation of “Vital Resources;” and, whereas, forty states of
the Union have prohibited the maintenance of houses of prostitution, the market
places of the white slave traffic and the centers for the dissemination of the
most dangerous and revolting diseases; and, whereas, the city administrations
of many of the larger cities, in defiance of state law, have set apart districts
where the crime of prostitution is tolerated and protected;</p>

<p>Therefore, be it resolved that we condemn such policy of segregation by city
officials as contrary to sound public policy and indefensible in morals, and
recommend the absolute suppression of the social evil in all its phases.</p>

<p>I move the adoption of the resolution, Mr. Chairman.</p>

<p>The motion was seconded, put, and carried.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Presentation of Invitations from Cities Desiring the Next Congress</span></h3>
<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">White</span>—We will pass to the next order—the presentation
of invitations from the cities desiring the next Congress. This is the
usual way. These invitations are not acted upon, because the Executive
Committee will take three or four months to consider everything and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
compare the different cities, looking to the welfare of the next Congress.
Mr. Don Carlos Ellis, of Knoxville, Tenn., I believe has something to
say.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, Mr. Don Carlos Ellis</span></h3>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ellis</span>—Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: There is to be
held in the city of Knoxville, in September and October of next year,
the National Conservation Exposition. Its purpose and nature are precisely
parallel with those of this Congress—for the promotion of the development,
wise use and conservation of all of the natural resources of
this Nation. The Exposition is of national scope, but is to have special
reference to the Southern States. There are to be buildings set aside
for each one of the five divisions of our natural resources—forests, minerals,
soils, waters and vital resources. In these buildings are to be
shown, by example, as this Congress has shown by precept, the various
results accomplished by Conservation by the Federal Government, the
State governments and by private individuals, and the possibilities of
Conservation in the future.</p>

<p>The Exposition originated in Washington last February, when a
number of the leading spirits of Conservation met in that city and there
was formed an Advisory Board composed of the gentlemen whose names
I desire to read to you:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Gifford Pinchot, President National Conservation Association, Chairman;
Don Carlos Ellis, in charge Educational Co-operation, United States Forest
Service, Secretary; Philander P. Claxton, United States Commissioner of
Education; Miss Julia C. Lathrop, Chief of the Children’s Bureau, United
States Department of Commerce and Labor; Dr. Harvey W. Wiley, Director of
the Bureau of Foods, Sanitation, and Health, of Good Housekeeping Magazine;
W. J. McGee, Soil Water Expert, United States Department of Agriculture;
Senator Duncan U. Fletcher of Florida, President Southern Commercial Congress;
Logan W. Page, Director United States Office of Public Roads; Bradford
Knapp, in charge Farmers Co-operative Demonstration Work, United
States Department of Agriculture; Jos. A. Holmes, Director United Bureau of
Mines; Representative Joseph E. Ransdell of Louisiana, President National
Rivers and Harbors Congress; Senator Luke Lea of Tennessee; Charles S. Barrett,
President Farmers’ Educational and Co-operative Union.</p>
</div>

<p>These various members of the Advisory Board are to represent, in the
formation of plans for the Exposition, the various departments of Conservation
in which they are acknowledged leaders. They have instructed
me, as Secretary of this Advisory Board, to read to the delegates the
following letters:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p style="text-align:right;">September 23, 1912.</p>

<p>To the Delegates of the Fourth National Conservation Congress, Indianapolis,
Indiana:
</p>

<p>We, the undersigned members of the Advisory Board of the National Conservation
Exposition, take this means of laying before you an outline of the plans
and purposes of the Exposition and of respectfully recommending the adoption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
of the resolutions which will be introduced at this Congress endorsing the National
Conservation Exposition.</p>

<p>This Exposition is to be held at Knoxville, Tennessee, in September and
October of 1913. It is an outgrowth of the Appalachian Exposition, which has
been held at Knoxville for the past two years. Knoxville was chosen as the
location of the National Conservation Exposition because the Southern States
are in great need of education concerning the proper handling of their great
natural wealth; because Knoxville, while in the South, is readily accessible to the
entire East; because the State in which it lies is in the transition zone between
North and South and has more States bordering upon it than any other State
in the Nation, and all the bordering States are southern; because the city is in
the center of the region where the National Government is establishing new
National Forests and carrying on other lines of work in Conservation to a
greater extent than in any other region; and because of the city’s preparedness
in being willing to turn over to the National Conservation Exposition Company
the excellent buildings and grounds which had been acquired for the Appalachian
Exposition Company and to raise sufficient additional capital besides. A bill
has been introduced in Congress providing for a government building and exhibit
at the Exposition, and the Committee to which it was referred has given assurances
of a favorable report for a quarter of a million dollars.</p>

<p>The purpose of the Appalachian Exposition was to aid in the development
of the Southern Appalachian Region. The new Exposition is a national, not a
local project. Its work is to promote the preservation and development of the
different forms of natural wealth of the entire country. Its special field, however,
is to be the Southern States. The Exposition comes at a time when these
States are in the midst of a great awakening. It is to be devoted in an especial
manner to assist in this awakening and in directing the course of this awakening
toward genuine, permanent progress and highest efficiency. The purposes are
parallel with the magnificent undertakings of the National Conservation Congress.
The means only are different. To every part of the Nation the Congress
is sending its message. The Exposition invites the people of the Nation to view
the tangible results and possibilities of Conservation on display. All fields of the
Conservation work will be represented, forests, waters, lands, minerals, fish and
game, and human efficiency including health, child welfare, education, home economics,
good roads, and country life improvement. The Exposition is to be held
at a time when special efforts are to be made by such agencies as the southern
railroads and the Southern Commercial Congress to direct the tide of passenger
traffic through the South. During the same period the city of Mobile, Alabama,
is to entertain the Fifth Annual Convention of the Southern Commercial Congress
and to hold its celebration of the opening of the Panama Canal, and plans
are being made to direct southern travelers of those two months through both
Mobile and Knoxville.</p>

<p>Expositions of the past have been commemorative and historical. They have
celebrated and glorified past achievements. The field of the new Exposition is
the future. It is to tell the progress which we are to make in the coming years,
which we are to enjoy ourselves and to hand down to our children. It will be
prophetic of the development which is to come and of the permanent enrichment
of the country and its people. In the words of the late and beloved Dr. W. J.
McGee, “The change thus wrought in the exposition idea is fundamental; the
old exposition looked backward, the new looks forward; the old exposition was
solely material, the new is essentially moral; the old was a proud boast of
achievement, the new a signpost to progress and an assurance of perpetuity. The
expositions of the past were as songs of achievement at the end of a good day’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</span>
work, the new may well be as living and tangible promises of a still more
glorious tomorrow foreordained by the wise action of today.”</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, Knoxville has empowered me to invite to that city, to
the Exposition, the fifth meeting of the National Conservation Congress.
The National Conservation Congress belongs to the whole Nation, and the
Nation is proud of it. For the past four years, since its birth, it has held
its meetings in the North and Northwest. The South needs the Congress,
particularly at this time, when it is in a phase of its great industrial
awakening, and it earnestly urges that the Congress come within
its bounds next year. If it should come South next year, there is certainly
no more fitting place for its sessions than in that city which has
done so much by its own energies and industries for Conservation as has
Knoxville. It will be centering in Knoxville in that year and at that
time all the forces working for Conservation throughout the United
States. Knoxville is a smaller city than others in the South where the
Congress might be held, but it is a city of between seventy and eighty
thousand people. It has five excellent hotels. Two main railroads run
through, and it has shown its ability to handle large crowds of people
by the way it has taken care of the Appalachian Exposition for two
years, with an average of twelve thousand visitors a day.</p>

<p>The Exposition is moving along parallel lines with the Congress, and
it is in a way an offspring of the efforts of this Congress. It has taken
up the ideas that have been promulgated by this Congress, and is going
to apply them by showing at Knoxville the tangible, visible results of
Conservation. The people in that section of country are in great need
of instruction along these lines.</p>

<p>The plant already established for this other exposition is valued at
between one-half and one million dollars. Already several buildings
have been erected, and all this has been turned over to the new Exposition
as a foundation.</p>

<p>I have letters with me from the various commercial bodies of the
city, and this has been also heartily endorsed by the Governor of the
State.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span></p>

<p>In conclusion, I wish to offer a resolution made by the Advisory
Board:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Whereas, It is the sense of the Fourth National Conservation Congress, assembled
at Indianapolis, Indiana, October 1 to 4, 1912, that the National Conservation
Exposition, to be held at Knoxville, Tennessee, in September and
October, 1913, will be a strong factor in the advancement of the Conservation
and wise use of the national resources of this Nation, and particularly of the
Southern States; and</p>

<p>Whereas, It is, further, the sense of this Congress that education in the care
of natural resources is particularly needed in the Southern States, where the
resources are of great value and their development in a period of a great
awakening, but their Conservation at a low ebb; therefore, be it</p>

<p>Resolved, That the National Conservation Congress hereby signifies its
gratification that the National Conservation Exposition is to take place, and its
earnest hope that all persons and institutions interested in the Conversation of
any of our natural resources will give to the Exposition their cordial support and
co-operation.</p>
</div>

<p>I move the adoption of this resolution.</p>


<p>Hon. <span class="smcap">R. M. Austin</span>, Congressman from Tennessee—I wish to second
this as a citizen of that progressive city, and I wish to join in the invitation
extended by Mr. Ellis, not only to the delegates to this National Conservation
Congress, but also to the citizens of this great capital city of
Indiana. I hope this invitation will be accepted and this resolution just
read will be passed. We will be happy to see you all when you come to
sunny Tennessee, away up in the mountains, and this little city of ours
of about eighty thousand people, which nestles at the foot of the Great
Smoky Mountain. We will show you the richest mineral and timber section
in all the Union. There are ten counties in this Congressional District.
Five have coal, six iron, six marble, five zinc, two copper, and
the largest amount of hardwood timber now existing on the American
continent. It is an ideal location, not only for a Conservation Exposition,
but an ideal place for a meeting of this great and useful organization,
the National Conservation Congress of America, and we hope you
will all come.</p>

<p>Mr. Chairman, we do not intend to open the doors of the Exposition
until we know that Captain White, of Kansas City, answers “Present.”
(Applause.)</p>

<p>I wish, while I am on my feet, to commend the very excellent report
from the Committee on Resolutions submitted by the able editor of “The
World’s Work,” Mr. Page, and to say that so long as I am a representative
in Congress I shall, by my influence, do all that I can to carry out
the principles set forth in these resolutions. (Applause.)</p>

<p>The motion on Mr. Ellis’ resolution was put and carried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span></p>


<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">A. M. Loomis</span> (New York)—I wish, very briefly, to read the
action of the New York State delegation, adopted possibly before this
matter of the Knoxville Exposition had become known.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>The New York delegation at this, the Fourth National Conservation Congress,
wishes to go on record in favor of asking the delegates to this great body
to hold the next annual meeting in the East,—to be more explicit, in New York
State. There is an urgent reason why the work of the Congress at a point
nearer the great centers of the business and wealth of the country, and in the
section of the more crowded population would have wider effectiveness, and
greater force along lines of practical understanding of its work, and needed
legislation in favor of the great reforms for which it stands.</p>

<p>One point in New York State stands out in particular as the ideal place
for this Congress to gather, namely Chautauqua, the home of the great Chautauqua
Institution, on the shores of beautiful Chautauqua Lake. At this point,
in a little city in the woods, are ample accommodations both for meeting places,
exhibits, and housing for a gathering of five thousand people. The Assembly
houses more than double that number for ten weeks each summer and has an
auditorium hardly excelled in America, seating more than eight thousand people,
as well as many other halls and buildings for meeting places and exhibits.</p>

<p>This institution stands for all that the highest aims of this Congress point
to, in education, morality, and direction of human effort. Its reputation is
world wide, and its home offers an ideal meeting place for the Conservationists,
ideal in that for which the two institutions stand, and ideal in location, accommodations,
railroad facilities and the economy with which a great meeting of
this kind could be conducted there.</p>

<p>The New York delegation unites in inviting the Congress to choose Chautauqua,
New York, as the place of its next meeting.</p>
</div>


<p>Chairman <span class="smcap">White</span>—The chair, in behalf of the delegates, wishes to
thank the representatives from New York who have invited us to Chautauqua,
as well as the representatives from Tennessee for inviting us to
Knoxville. This subject will be referred to the Executive Committee,
who will, in their wisdom, consider it all as it may relate to the best
success of our cause.</p>

<p>Is there anything more to be presented at this convention? If not,
the chair will state that the Fourth National Conservation Congress is
now about to pass into history. Tomorrow will be the beginning of a
new Congress—the Fifth Annual Congress, with the new President and
new officers in some respects—but with a great many of the old ones, too—and
we hope that all who are here will be present at the next Congress,
the Fifth National Conservation Congress, wherever it may be held.
And in the meantime the work will go on. It will begin tomorrow and
continue throughout the year. Everywhere any delegate has influence,
the cause will be heard and will be advanced.</p>

<p>The Chair wishes to thank this Congress and its delegates for the
kind consideration given him while he has been presiding, and for the
support he has received from every one. We now stand adjourned, subject
to the call of the Executive Committee. (Applause.)</p>

</div>
<hr class="r5">
<h2><span class="hidden">FORESTRY SECTION</span></h2>
<p class="center"><em>FORESTRY SECTION.</em></p>

<p>Delegates specially interested in Forestry held section meetings in
the Turkish Room of the Claypool Hotel throughout the sessions of the
Fourth National Conservation Congress. The Standing Committee on
Forestry consisted of Prof. Henry S. Graves, Chairman; J. B. White,
Major E. G. Griggs, George K. Smith, William Irvine and E. T. Allen.
Chairman Graves, being unavoidably absent, delegated Mr. Allen to arrange
meeting facilities and represent him in an effort to further the
progress of forestry at the Congress.</p>

<p>The first session of the Forestry Section was held on the evening of
October 1, with about twenty-five foresters and lumbermen present.
(At later sessions the attendance increased to forty.)</p>

<p>Mr. Allen, acting as Chairman, announced that Professor Graves had
suggested that such preliminary meeting be called to determine, first,
if a section meeting on Forestry should be conducted, and if so, the lines
it should follow. Mr. Allen suggested the probable advantage of formulating
plans for more systematic forestry work at future Congresses,
and of utilizing the opportunity thus afforded to exchange experiences
and ideas on legislation, forest protection and educational work. The
meeting concurred in this suggestion and determined to hold a series of
meetings on Forestry at this Congress.</p>


<p class="center"><em>Second Session—10 a. m., October 2.</em></p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. D. Page Simons</span></h3>
<p>Mr. E. T. Allen called the meeting to order, and Mr. D. Page Simons,
of California, was chosen secretary. The chair then presented a tentative
program for ensuing sessions covering publicity work, co-operation
in forest protection, needed forest legislation, and organization for future
Congresses. He described the educational work conducted by the Western
Forestry and Conservation Association, and read a communication
from Professor Graves, United States Forester, emphasizing the need of
a propaganda for more adequate and uniform State forest legislation.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Mr. T. B. Wyman</span></h3>
<p>Mr. T. B. Wyman, of Michigan, representing the Northern Forest
Protective Association, then described the co-operative effort by Michigan
lumbermen covering a territory of seven and one-half million acres.
He told how they had been enabled to maintain a patrol service and that
their association had made a careful study of fire causes. In the campaign
of public education, he said, they had utilized modern advertising
methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span></p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Maj. E. G. Griggs</span></h3>
<p>Major E. G. Griggs, of Washington, President of the National Lumber
Manufacturers’ Association, pointed out the necessity of united effort
in a campaign of education which would bring about a better understanding,
on the part of the public, of all phases of forest industry. He
emphasized the need of continuous effort throughout the year, and said
that he believed there should be some national frame-work or organization
which would unite the foresters and lumbermen for such continuous
and concerted action. Major Griggs also praised the work of the United
States Forest Service.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. Charles Lathrop Pack</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Charles Lathrop Pack, of New Jersey, concurred in Major Griggs’
suggestion and said that he believed the Conservation Congress, meeting
annually, illustrated the need of a Committee on Forestry, which would
be active throughout the year. He said that he believed that other
features of the Congress had been much better advertised and organized
and that he hoped that before another year the work of the Forestry
Committee, particularly, would be on a systematic basis with the necessary
funds to carry forward its work.</p>

<p>Chairman Allen pointed out the need of local publicity as was illustrated
by the difficulties experienced in obtaining adequate State legislation.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. I. C. Williams</span></h3>
<p>Mr. I. C. Williams, of Pennsylvania, Deputy State Forest Commissioner,
said that taxation and not fire protection was the big forestry
problem in Pennsylvania. He said that a campaign of publicity for a
yield tax measure had been unsuccessful owing to a lack of organization
among the friends of the measure to back up the publicity.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Dr. Henry S. Drinker</span></h3>
<p>Dr. Henry S. Drinker, of Pennsylvania, President of Lehigh University,
reported the distribution of a million circulars on forest protection,
modeled on those issued by the Western Forestry and Conservation
Association. He also endorsed the yield tax principle.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. E. A. Sterling</span></h3>
<p>Mr. E. A. Sterling, of Pennsylvania, emphasized the importance of
conducting a systematic campaign of publicity which would bring out
definite facts. Competent committees, he said, should be in charge of
such work so that the publicity would be in effective form and carry
weight.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Hon. John M. Woods</span></h3>
<p>Hon. John M. Woods, Mayor of Somerville, Mass., suggested the
danger of relying too much on education and not enough on practical
politics. In his judgment, forest legislation could best be furthered by
interesting the Governor and the Legislature.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. Henry E. Hardtner</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Henry E. Hardtner, of Louisiana, told of the forest laws of that
State and of his effort to secure reforestation.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Prof. F. W. Rane</span></h3>
<p>Prof. F. W. Rane, State Forester of Massachusetts, said that results
are a question of enterprising organization and that more system and
effective committee work will bring better results.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Col. W. R. Brown</span></h3>
<p>Col. W. R. Brown, representing the New Hampshire Forestry Commission,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</span>
said that he believed the American Forestry Association offered
facilities for the work under discussion and that means for utilizing them
could be devised.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. F. A. Elliott</span></h3>
<p>Mr. F. A. Elliott, State Forester of Oregon, then outlined western
problems which he showed were peculiarly difficult because of a lack of
forest appreciation in a new country. He testified to the efficiency of
advertising propaganda to reduce fire carelessness.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. Hugh P. Baker</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Hugh P. Baker, of New York, said that the Empire State went on
the principle that people had to be shown and that, therefore, they were
making a feature of demonstration forests and of assisting individual
owners.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. P. S. Ridsdale</span></h3>
<p>Mr. P. S. Ridsdale, of Washington, D. C., Secretary of the American
Forestry Association, then told of the educational policy of that organization,
and said that its magazine was devoting special attention to all
practical matters of interest to lumbermen.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Appointment of Committees on Resolutions</span></h3>
<p>After some further discussion along the line of desirable committee
action the Chair was instructed, by motion, duly seconded and carried,
to appoint two committees, each of which he should be ex officio chairman,
as follows: A committee of five on permanent organization, and
one of three to represent the Forestry Section in a conference with the
American Forestry Association and the officers of the Fifth National
Conservation Congress. It was also agreed to appoint a Committee on
Resolutions. These committees were appointed, as follows:</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Co-operation with other agencies</span></h3>
<p>Co-operation with Other Agencies—E. T. Allen, chairman; H. S.
Graves, and J. B. White.</p>

<p>Permanent Organization—E. T. Allen, Chairman; F. A. Elliott, Don
Carlos Ellis, T. B. Wyman, and F. W. Rane.</p>

<p>Resolutions—Dr. Henry S. Drinker, chairman; F. W. Besley, D. P.
Simons, P. S. Ridsdale, and H. E. Hardtner.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><span class="hidden">THIRD SESSION—</span></h2>
<p class="center"><a href="#contents"><em>Third Session—2:40 p. m., October 2.</em></a></p>
</div>
<p>Co-operative Forest Protection was announced for the topic for discussion.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. H. E. Hardtner</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Hardtner told of the success of the Louisiana lumber associations
in securing legislation.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. T. B. Wyman</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Wyman told of the co-operative patrol of the Northern Forest
Protective Association, in Michigan, and described briefly their methods
and the fire fighting equipment.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Col. W. R. Brown</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Brown explained the methods of the New Hampshire Timberland
Owners’ Association. There are four district chiefs, each in charge of
a patrol system. They utilize all modern devices, such as telephones,
lookouts, tool depots, etc. They have reduced the fire damage one-half
at a cost of seven-tenths of one per cent. of the values protected. Mr.
Brown urged that the adjoining States should co-operate along boundaries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span></p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. F. A. Elliott</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Elliott told of the progress being made in Oregon under their new
law providing for syndicate co-operative patrol maintained jointly by
the Federal and State governments, the counties and lumbermen.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. N. P. Wheeler</span></h3>
<p>Mr. N. P. Wheeler told of the fight against forest fires by Pennsylvania
lumbermen.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. D. Page Simmons</span></h3>
<p>Mr. D. P. Simons described the organization of the Washington Forest
Fire Association, which maintains over a hundred patrolmen and
protects nearly five million acres. This association also has been very
successful in publicity and legislative work.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Report, Committee on Resolutions</span></h3>
<p>The report of the Committee on Resolutions was then presented, discussed
by sections and adopted. (See resolutions of Fourth National
Conservation Congress—Forests.)</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><span class="hidden">FOURTH SESSION—</span></h2>
<p class="center"><a href="#contents"><em>Fourth Session—8:25 p. m., October 3.</em></a></p>
</div>
<h3><span class="hidden">Committee on Permanent Organizations</span></h3>
<p>Chairman Allen reported that the Committee on Resolutions of the
Conservation Congress, of which he was Secretary, had endorsed the
resolutions presented by the Forestry Section.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Report, Mr. E. T. Allen</span></h3>
<p>Chairman Allen then read the following report from the Section
Committee on Permanent Organization:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Your committee believes that the consensus of opinion of the lumbermen and
foresters assembled at the invitation of the forestry committee of the Fourth
National Conservation Congress is about as follows:</p>

<p>1. That the Congress has not so far included satisfactory facilities for
securing for forest matters the attention they deserve at such a meeting.</p>

<p>2. That the facilities to be desired should provide for two main activities:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(a) The general discussion of forest Conservation needed to bring its
importance properly before the public.</p>

<p>(b) The meeting for mutual help, in practical constructive detailed
work of the men actually engaged in organized forest work.</p>
</div>

<p>3. That unless there is early assurance of such facilities hereafter, the
Congress’ support from forest interests is in danger.</p>

<p>4. That private, state and federal forest interests are anxious to support
the Congress and in turn to receive all benefit to be derived from it.</p>

<p>5. That what is clearly needed is a greater recognition of forestry upon its
general program and arrangement for sectional forest work outside the general
meeting, both to be carefully planned in advance so as to be practical, effective
and without lost time.</p>

<p>6. That probably similar steps should be taken to provide for other branches
of Conservation work, so that all may unite in perpetuating the usefulness of
the Congress.</p>

<p>7. That the duty of your committee is to bring about the things outlined
above, or at least to suggest some means of doing so.</p>

<p>After careful consideration of what these seven points involve, your committee
feels that the very fact that inadequacy in the past has prevented as wide
an attendance as desirable, prevents us from conferring at this time as fully
with all agencies involved as would be sure to get the best result, and that in
particular we are at a great disadvantage in being unable to confer with the
executive officers of the 1913 Congress not yet chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span></p>

<p>For these reasons we recommend as our very best judgment that this meeting
correct us as far as may be necessary in stating its beliefs and desires and
then leave working out the detail until we can offer the executive officials of
the next Congress the courtesy of consulting with them, with the understanding,
however, that there shall be no negligence or unnecessary delay and that long
before the next Congress all these matters shall be arranged in detail and given
the necessary publicity.</p>

<p>Your committee consequently recommends further either that it be given
instructions to act as suggested, or that it be discharged and the duties outlined
be added to those of the committee of three already appointed to discuss
similar questions. We believe that a faithful attempt to work the matter out
in this way will be more satisfactory than trying to settle matters at this session.
There is ample time if we do not waste it, and less danger of error.</p>
</div>

<p>The report was adopted, following the suggestion that the Committee
on Permanent Organization be discharged and its duties imposed upon
the permanent co-operative committee, including E. T. Allen, Prof. H. S.
Graves and J. B. White.</p>

<p>Mr. Allen, being called out to assist in revising the resolutions of the
general Congress, asked Mr. Sterling to take the chair, and suggested
the reading of a paper sent by Chief Forester Graves, outlining the policy
of the Forest Service.</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. Z. D. Scott and Mr. F. A. Elliott</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Graves’ paper (appearing elsewhere in the proceedings of the
Congress) was animatedly discussed, the meeting without dissenting voice
approving the Forest Service policy and deploring any attempt to restrict
its operation. Short talks urging its support by all forest interests,
State and private, including the Conservation Congress, were made
by Z. D. Scott, Minnesota; F. A. Elliott and H. D. Langille, Oregon, and
W. H. Shippen, Georgia. A resolution was passed emphasizing the
meeting’s endorsement of the resolutions commending the Forest Service
then before the general Congress (and adopted the following day).</p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Remarks, Mr. H. D. Langille and Mr. W. H. Shippen</span></h3>
<p>Mr. Langille spoke particularly against the turning over of the National
forests to State control and Mr. Shippen of the necessity of
Federal control of interstate watersheds.</p>

<p>A discussion of State legislation followed. Mr. Scott described the
effort of Minnesota under its new law. Leonard Bronson, Washington,
outlined the trend of attempted tax reform, dwelling particularly upon
the yield tax system proposed by Professor Fairchild of Yale University,
and urged concerted, harmonious effort by all forest States. Dr.
Drinker and Mr. Wheeler reviewed the proposed Pennsylvania law for a
nominal land tax and a yield tax from which counties are to be reimbursed
for taxes lost during growing period.</p>

<p>Upon motion of Mr. I. C. Williams, Pennsylvania, the meeting went
on record as considering tax reform to promote reforestation and better
forest management, the most important problem and the one most in
need of study and legislation of any before the forest interests of the
United States today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span></p>
<h3><span class="hidden">Register, Forestry Section</span></h3>
<p>The Forestry Section of the Fourth National Conservation Congress
then adjourned, leaving plans for more effective work in 1913 in the
hands of the committee of three previously mentioned.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Present Situation of Forestry”</span></h3>
<p class="center">THE PRESENT SITUATION OF FORESTRY.</p>

<p class="center">Prof. <span class="smcap">Henry S. Graves</span>, United States Forester.</p>

<p>A review of the work of forestry in this country during the past year
shows that in many directions there has been substantial progress and
positive achievement. On the other hand, the continued organized
attacks on the National Forest system, and the efforts to break it down
or cripple it, present a situation of real danger which the country should
realize and vigorously meet. We have before us a task of constructive
activity in practical work, extending and building on foundations already
laid; we have also the task of preventing a destructive attack upon
National forestry.</p>

<p>During the past few years public interest in forestry has been rapidly
changing from a mere inquiry in regard to its purpose to a vigorous
demand for practical results. This more intelligent public sentiment
is now finding its expression in a growing appreciation of the need of
better forest laws, greater State appropriations for fire control, and increasing
interest in forest protection by private timberland owners. It
often happens that public attention is caught only by the most striking
new departments and developments, such as a change in public policy or
important legislation, while but little is known of the steady advance
in applied forestry. The past year has been signalized not so much by
new undertakings as by marked accomplishment in the effective carrying
out of work previously inaugurated.</p>


<p class="center">PROGRESS IN NATIONAL FORESTRY.</p>

<p>Every year shows increased efficiency in the administration of the
national forests. The most conspicuous advance has been in organized
fire protection. The disastrous year of 1910 taught many lessons. While
that disaster could not have been avoided in the absence of better transportation
and communication facilities and without a larger patrol force
than the Forest Service could put into the field, it nevertheless showed
how, even under the present conditions, the work of protection could be
made more effective. Full use was made of the experience gained in that
year, and during the past two seasons the loss by fire has been kept down
to a comparatively small amount through the efficient system now in
force. The problem, however, of fire protection on the national forests
is far from being solved. There still remain to be built some 80,000
miles of trails, 45,000 miles of telephone lines, many miles of roads, many
lookout stations, and other improvements, before even the primary system
of control will have been established. The funds at the disposal of
the Forest Service are still inadequate to employ the patrolmen needed
to meet more than ordinary emergency. There is even yet danger, therefore,
that in the case of a great drought like that of 1910 some fires might
gain the mastery and a similar disaster follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span></p>

<p>An account of the progress of the work of the Forest Service in the
administration of the national forests would be an enumeration of the
different activities in which the work is going on with constantly growing
effectiveness. Many of the local difficulties of administration are rapidly
disappearing. This is due to the steadily closer co-ordination of the
interests of the Government with those of the people living in and using
the forests. More and more these people are coming to appreciate that
their interests and those of the national forests are one. With a better
understanding of the aims and methods of the Forest Service, local difficulties
are disappearing and local support of the service is largely replacing
opposition. Those who are aiming to destroy the national forest
system are not the settlers and others who use the forests, but rather
men who seek for their own advantage special privileges to which they
are not entitled, and who wish to acquire for little or nothing valuable
resources for speculation and personal gain.</p>

<p>During the past year the Weeks law, authorizing the purchase of
lands on navigable streams, has been put into effect, and the Government
has already entered into contracts for the purchase of 230,000 acres in
the Southern Appalachian Mountains, and about 72,000 acres in the
White Mountains. These lands are being secured on the most desirable
areas, and it has been possible to obtain them for reasonable prices. A
special feature of the Weeks law is the co-operation between the Government
and the States in fire protection on watersheds of navigable streams.
The law provides $200,000, until expended, for such co-operation; but
this money can be used only in States which have already inaugurated
a system of fire protection under public direction. During the year
1911 there were eleven States which qualified under this law, receiving
in the aggregate about $40,000. During the current year sums varying
from $1,500 to $10,000 have been allotted to the States of Maine, New
Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland,
Wisconsin, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington. There is still sufficient
money left from the original appropriation for substantial co-operation
during another year. It has been the aim of the Forest Service
to spread the money over three years in order that there may be a
full demonstration of what can be accomplished, and at what cost. It
will then be possible to present to Congress a satisfactory basis upon
which to consider whether Federal aid to the States should be continued.</p>

<p>The most urgent need of the national forest work is more ample
provision of the funds necessary for adequate protection of the forests
against fire. It is especially urgent that the work of constructing roads,
trails, telephone lines, and other improvements needed for fire protection

<p class="center">PROGRESS IN STATE FORESTRY.</p>

<p>A very great obligation rests upon the State governments in working
out the problem of forestry. Organized fire protection under State
direction, the establishment of a reasonable system of taxation of growing
timber, honest and conservative management of State forest laws,
education of woodland owners to better methods of forestry, and such
practical regulation of handling private forests as may be required for
the protection of the public, are problems which require the immediate
action of all States.</p>

<p>While no State is as yet accomplishing all that it should, a number
of them are making very rapid progress, and are giving as liberal money
support as perhaps could be expected under the present conditions. The
feature of State forestry which stands out most strongly is that a number
of States have gone beyond merely passing forest laws, and have begun
to provide the funds necessary to achieve practical results. At last it is
beginning to be recognized that the prevention of fire is the fundamental
necessity, and that this can be accomplished only through an organized
public service. In order to make laws effective there must be adequate
machinery to carry them out. The fundamental principle of fire protection
is preparation. A forest region must be watched for fires, both
to prevent their being started and to reach quickly and put out such as
from one cause or another may get under way. The new State legislation
recognizes this need, and already there has been inaugurated a
measure of watchfulness in the season of greatest danger, through patrol
or lookouts under State direction. During 1911, which was a banner
year in the enactment of State legislation, laws related chiefly to fire
protection were passed by Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin; while Colorado
created the office of State Forester. Since the beginning of 1912
Maryland and New York have amended their forest laws, and Kentucky
has passed its first complete law.</p>

<p>It is exceedingly gratifying that substantial progress is now being
made in the South. Unfortunately, however, none of the Southern
States except Maryland has hitherto been able to qualify to receive Federal
aid and fire protection under the Weeks law. It is hoped that
during the coming year progress will be made in those Southern States
in which practically nothing has yet been done.</p>

<p>One of the matters to which the Conservation Congress and all other
educational agencies should devote their efforts is to bring about the
protection of private lands from fire and the extension to them of forestry
methods. While some may say that this is a matter for which the
owner is personally responsible, the fact remains that private owners
will ordinarily not work out the forestry problem on their lands without
the participation of the public in the form of public regulations, co-operation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
and assistance. This is recognized in some States, but others
are doing nothing whatever in this field, and a good many which have
made a small beginning are abundantly able to do vastly more than at
present. It has usually happened that the securing of good forest laws
and the establishment of a State Forest Service has been brought about
by the efforts of a small group of interested men, and frequently through
the efforts of a single individual who has been able to arouse the interest
of the people in his State. Enough States in different parts of the
country have initiated State forestry to make it comparatively easy for a
State contemplating new legislation to benefit by what has been done elsewhere.
All that is really required in the extension of State forestry is
to find the man or men in each State who will take the leadership and
follow up the matter until the Legislature acts. It would seem that in
the heavily timbered States the lumbermen are the men who should
be most vitally interested in the conservation of our forests. In some
States timberland owners have participated very actively in bringing
about State forestry, as for example, in Maine, New Hampshire, Minnesota,
and some of the far Northwest States. In other instances the
timberland owners have been indifferent and in some instances proper
State forestry has failed on account of the attitude of the very men who
should be foremost in promoting proper legislation. We need in each
State not so much advice from the outside as a few patriotic citizens in
whom the public has confidence and who will devote time and real effort
to this public task. If the men can be found to do this preliminary work
they will have no difficulty in securing competent assistance from other
States and from the National Government.</p>


<p class="center">THE ATTACK UPON FORESTRY.</p>

<p>At the same time that forestry has been making steady progress in
constructive work and in public esteem, hostility to the national forest
policy on the part of those who would substitute private for public control
of these resources has become more determined under a new form.
The early attacks upon this policy openly sought its overthrow. They
came to nothing because the country was emphatically for the forests.
At the present time those who attack the national forest policy commonly
profess allegiance to the Conservation principle even while attempting
to break it down. There is great danger that the public may
not understand what is involved in measures whose purpose and inevitable
effects do not appear on their face. Two such measures are the
proposal to require the elimination from the forests of all lands capable
of cultivation, on the plea that this will increase settlement, and the proposal
to turn all the forests over to the States in which they lie, on the
plea that this will increase their benefits to the people of these States.
In both cases quite the contrary is true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</span></p>

<p>An amendment which was attached to the Agricultural Appropriation
Bill last June, and which passed the Senate but was rejected by the
House, would have required, had it become law, the opening to private
acquisition under the homestead laws of all lands “fit and suitable for
agriculture” within national forests, irrespective of their value for other
purposes or of their importance for public use. The result would have
been not to facilitate but to block agricultural development. It would
also have been to transfer to powerful private interests timberlands,
water power sites, and other areas, possession of which would tend to
private monopoly of resources now under public control.</p>

<p>This measure is not called for in order that agricultural development
of lands in national forests may take place. The Forest Service has
consistently favored and sought to bring about agricultural settlement
of all national forest lands which can be put to their highest usefulness
by farming. It urged and obtained, seven years ago, the law which now
permits the opening of such land. Under that law about one and a half
million acres have been listed for entry by over twelve thousand settlers;
and more will be listed as it becomes possible to list the land
without defeating the very purpose of the law.</p>

<p>To open land certain because of its superior value for timber, water-power
development, or other purposes to be absorbed by speculators or
powerful interests would not only defeat the purpose of the existing law
but also constitute a breach of public trust and a betrayal of the fundamental
principles of Conservation. That principle has often been misrepresented
as a policy of present non-use for the sake of future generations.
Its true purpose is two-fold: to prevent monopoly of public
resources, and to secure their greatest use, both present and future, by
scientific development. The national forests are administered with a view
to securing, first, use of present resources; second, permanency of such
resources; and third, greater and more valuable resources for the future.</p>

<p>Experience has amply proved that the elimination, under pressure, of
national forest lands locally considered or alleged to be of agricultural
value but in point of fact more valuable for other purposes has led to
their early acquisition by timberland speculators, great lumber interests,
water-power companies, livestock companies, and others who desire the
lands for other ends than agriculture. In 1901 705,000 acres of heavily
timbered land were thus eliminated from the Olympic National Forest.
Ten years later only a little over one per cent of this land was under
cultivation, while three-fourths of it was held for its timber, mainly in
large holdings. Other examples might be multiplied. With a mandatory
law the pressure for opening land sought under cover of the claim
of agricultural value would be well-nigh irresistible in many cases.
Local agitation and political influence would in the end break down all
effort to maintain public control. Such piecemeal attack on the forests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
would be made without any opportunity for the public to know what
was going on. In the end the dismemberment of the national forests
would be effected.</p>

<p>The only safety for the maintenance of the policy which now receives
and has long received the overwhelming support of public sentiment lies
in a correct knowledge by the public of the actual situation with regard
to agricultural lands in national forests. It must be made plain that
all but an entirely insignificant part of the national forests is not susceptible
of profitable cultivation. The forests occupy the most rugged
and mountainous parts of the West. Topography, soil, and climate combine
to make them natural forest lands, not potential farm lands. The
areas which form an exception to this condition are not over four per
cent. of the total; and such areas are now being sought out by the Forest
Service and will, under the existing law, be made available for homestead
entry as fast as they can be opened without defeating the purpose of the
law itself. It is necessary that the country should understand the manner
in which bona fide settlement is being brought about in the national
forests, and also the motive of those who are trying to break down the
system of forest Conservation under the guise of promoting settlement.</p>

<p>There has been during the past two or three years a steadily growing
movement to turn over the national forests to the individual States.
During the past session of Congress a rider to the Agricultural Appropriation
Bill was offered in the Senate, providing for the grant of the
national forests to the several States, together with all other public lands,
including “all coal, mineral, timber, grazing, agricultural and other
lands, and all water and power rights and claims, and all rights upon
lands of any character whatsoever.” While the amendment was ruled
out on a point of order, it received a surprisingly large amount of
support.</p>

<p>The proposition so far as the national forests are concerned is to turn
over to the individual States property owned by the Nation covering a
net area of over one hundred and sixty million acres. This property
has an actual measurable value of at least two billion dollars, while from
the standpoint of its indirect value to the public no estimate on a money
basis could possibly be made. These are public resources which should
be handled in the interests of the public. Moreover, the problems involved
are such that they should definitely remain in the hands of the
National rather than be turned over to the State governments. The
property belongs to the Nation as a whole, and every citizen has an interest
in it. The Government has already made enormous grants to the
individual States, but always to further specific objects of national importance.
There should not be a moment’s consideration of the proposal
to turn the forests over to the States unless it can be clearly shown that
the interests both of the States and of the Nation are consistent with such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
action. In the case of the national forests, public interests both of the
Nation and of the States require their continued retention and management
by the National Government.</p>

<p>The scope of this paper does not permit a full discussion of this
problem. It must suffice to mention a few cogent reasons for government
ownership:</p>

<p>1. The property is now owned by the Nation, and should be administered
from the standpoint of national as well as of local needs.</p>

<p>2. The problem of protection from fire and of timber production on
the national forests is one of national scope and can be properly handled
only by the Government; its solution is a national duty.</p>

<p>3. The problem of water control is no less a national duty. Nearly
all of the national forests lie on headwaters of navigable rivers or interstate
streams. The Government is now purchasing lands in the East on
headwaters of navigable rivers because of the disastrous results to the
public which are following abuse under private ownership. It certainly
should not part with title to the same class of lands which it now owns in
the West. Every interstate stream presents problems which can be properly
handled only through the Federal Government. The Government
cannot permit the citizens of one State to be damaged by the action or
failure to act of citizens of another State. It is of vital importance for
this reason alone that property at the headwaters of interstate streams
be retained under Government administration.</p>

<p>4. Not only are the interests of the individual States and communities
now fully protected, but in many ways far more is being done for
local communities than would be possible under State ownership. In
the long run, as the timber and other resources are brought into use with
improving markets, the States will receive from the twenty-five per cent.
of the gross receipts now allowed them and the additional ten per cent.
appropriated for road improvements a larger amount than would come in
from local taxes under private ownership.</p>

<p>5. The States are not as well prepared, financially or otherwise, to
handle the national forests as is the Federal Government. If the forests
were owned by the States and handled in the real interests of the public,
there would be substantially the same system of administration as today,
at a greater aggregate cost for supervision by a considerable number of
independent State staffs of technical men. The financial burden would
be far too great for the individual States to assume. The result would
be either poor administration and lack of protection, or a sacrifice of the
public interests in order to secure revenue to meet the financial needs.</p>

<p>6. The successful application of forestry demands a stable administrative
policy for long periods. This can be secured far better under
National than under State control.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span></p>

<p>7. A much higher standard of constructive and technical efficiency
is possible under National than under State administration. The value
of the forests to the public depends directly on the skill with which
scientific knowledge is applied to the task of developing their highest
productiveness. Both in ability to carry on the research work required
for practical ends and in ability to command professional services of the
first order the Government possesses a striking advantage.</p>

<p>8. As largely undeveloped property the forests need heavy investments
of capital for their improvement. Their full productiveness can
be secured in no other way. The Government is now investing yearly in
the forests a considerable part of the appropriation made for them.
Even if the States did not seek to make them sources of immediate revenue
at whatever sacrifice of their future possibilities, they would be
reluctant to expend much for their development.</p>

<p>9. The States both lack the civil service system and standards of the
National Government and are exposed to greater danger of being swayed
by private interests. In the hands of spoilsmen demoralization would
quickly succeed the present high standards of the Forest Service, while
the intimate relation of the forests to the welfare of great numbers of
individuals would tend to make their administrative control a highly
coveted political prize. At the same time the value of their resources
would certainly arouse a cupidity which would be exceedingly difficult to
control. Scandalous maladministration might easily follow. The Federal
Government is better watched farther removed from local influence,
more stable, and better equipped with a non-political system and machinery.</p>

<p>The underlying purpose of the proposed transfer of the national
forests to the States is really not to substitute State for Federal control,
but rather to substitute individual for public control. Its most earnest
advocates are the very interests which wish to secure such control. The
object of the whole states rights movement as it affects the national forests
is to transfer to private owners for speculative or monopolistic purposes
public resources of enormous value. Retention of these resources
under public ownership is needed to protect the people from abuses
which are every day being demonstrated on lands over which the public
has already lost control. The proposition is one which the people as a
whole would repudiate in an instant if they understood what is proposed.
The only danger lies in the fact that some legislation adverse to the
national forest system may be passed when the public as a whole is
ignorant that it is planned or does not understand the meaning. Vigilance
in the defense of its interests and intelligence in the perception of
the true character of masked attacks upon those interests are of fundamental
necessity if the public is to protect itself.</p>

<h2><span class="hidden">FOOD SECTION</span></h2>
<p class="center"><a href="#contents"><em>FOOD SECTION.</em></a></p>
</div>
<p>The Food Section of the National Conservation Congress met in the
Palm Room of the Claypool Hotel on the afternoon of October 1st. Dr.
H. W. Wiley, late Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry, as Chairman, discussed
the cold storage industry and pointed out that cold storage is a
great blessing to the country, in that goods are placed in cold storage
that they may be more evenly distributed throughout the year. He
showed that there is still room for the investigation of the principles of
storage and improvement of the industry. The condition of food entering
cold storage is most important.</p>

<p>Frank A. Horne, Chairman of the Commission of Legislation of the
American Association of Refrigeration, said there has been a remarkable
reversal of public opinion in the last three or four years regarding the
place cold storage and refrigerating has occupied with regard to the high
cost of living.</p>

<p>He declared the cold storage business has been unjustly assailed, and
that a series of investigations and hearings had demonstrated beyond
doubt that the popular notion and sensational newspaper attacks were
entirely unfounded and erroneous. He said these investigations showed
that the cold storage warehousemen performed a useful public function
in conserving perishable foods, preventing deterioration and waste
by means of a scientific method by which the great surplus production
could be wholesomely preserved for later consumption.</p>

<p>Before cold storage came into use a period of flush production meant
a glut in the market, and large quantities of spoiled and utterly wasted
foods. With cold storage at hand the contrary conditions prevail.</p>

<p>At the general discussion on the subject afterward, Dr. Wiley said the
attacks made on the cold storage business five years ago were justified by
conditions. He said as a result of an investigation of the business, the
cold storage men themselves have joined with the Government to improve
conditions.</p>

<p>Charles H. Utley, President of the Quincy Market, Cold Storage and
Warehouse Company, Boston, said there would be no occasion for cold
storage or the use of any other means for preserving food if human food
was not to a greater or less extent perishable. If it were not perishable
it would be the practice of every individual to conserve a sufficient
amount of food as might be required. No better means of preventing
waste of food is known at the present time than by the use of cold
storage, and the use accomplishes most desirable results, advantageous
to both consumer and producer, by the conservation of food, which is
just as desirable as the conservation of our natural resources.</p>

<p>Dr. William A. Evans of Chicago, discussed the capacity of milk for
doing harm even when it looks, tastes and smells right. He said milk is a
great carrier of disease germs, and that for this reason it should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
produced close to the point of distribution. The nearer the baby gets
to the cow the more natural it is. Certified milk is all right when it is
really certified by a noninterested person, but properly pasteurized milk
is probably the safest for babies.</p>

<p>Dr. H. E. Barnard, Food and Drug Commissioner of Indiana, referred
to the fact that Indiana was the first State to pass a cold storage
law. He introduced resolutions pertaining to the conservation of food,
which were unanimously adopted. The resolution follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Whereas, The Conservation of the food products of our country is of the
greatest importance to our people, in order that they may have available the
maximum supplies of wholesome food; and</p>

<p>Whereas, The subject is deserving of serious consideration, so that production
may be encouraged and waste decreased; and</p>

<p>Whereas, The important function of the process of refrigeration is enlarging
and diversifying the supply of perishable foodstuffs, as applied in the preparation,
transportation and distribution of these goods, thereby giving consumers
a larger and more wholesome supply, preventing deterioration and waste,
is recognized as being desirable and necessary; therefore, be it</p>

<p>Resolved, That any legislation or administration restrictions or regulations
that may be required to properly control the business and protect the public
health should be uniform in the several states of the Nation, and be it further</p>

<p>Resolved, That the Congress recommends that the succeeding food committee
of the National Conservation Congress be specially charged with the duty of
studying the questions involved in the production, collection, sanitary preparation,
transportation, preservation and marketing of perishable foods, and to report
its findings to the succeeding Congress to the end that such report may be
made the basis of measures to better conserve the perishable foods of the
people, to improve the quality of such foods, increase their production, and to
promote such relations between the producer, handler and consumer as will
bring about a more nearly uniform price through each year.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “Food Conservation by Cold Storage”</span></h3>
<p class="center">FOOD CONSERVATION BY COLD STORAGE.</p>

<p class="center fs80">By <span class="smcap">F. G. Urner</span>, Editor, New York Produce Review.</p>

<p>The conservation of food may be considered from two points of view—first,
the safeguarding and preservation of the food currently produced;
second, the maintenance of those elements of fertility upon which
continuous production depends, and the improvement of methods of
production to the end that maximum yield may be realized from the
labor and material expended. Both considerations are of the utmost
importance in the present conditions of changing relation between the
domestic supply of food and the needs of nonproducers. In both progress
toward higher ideals is dependent upon an increase of knowledge, and
worthy of such educational forces as can be brought to bear by a wise
government. In both directions the United States Government, through
the Department of Agriculture and otherwise, is endeavoring, by investigation,
study and the dissemination of ascertained fact, to foster
progress for the common good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span></p>

<p>In the United States the development of food production to keep
pace with the needs of a population increasing at a rate beyond all
precedent, has been crude and wasteful. Beginning with virgin soils
the stores of primitive fertility have been drawn upon with little regard
for their steady depletion. Methods of careful and conservative agriculture
that have been forced upon older communities have been largely
ignored until comparatively recent years, when an appreciation of the
near approach of the inevitable results of waste has turned forceful
educational efforts toward a reformation—efforts which, however, have
been handicapped by the necessity of overcoming the prejudice of ignorance
and long established habit of carelessness.</p>

<p>Considered broadly, the question of conservation of food is far-reaching
and extends to innumerable details. It is the purpose in this
paper to discuss simply some of the general principles underlying the
subject from the first mentioned viewpoint—the safeguarding and preservation
of the food produced—particularly in respect to preservation by
cold storage.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to enlarge upon the general requirement of
food preservation. In northern latitudes, where months of production
are, in respect to a large part of the food supply, followed by months of
nonproduction, this necessity is evident not only to maintain a satisfactory
variety of food but to secure a sufficient quantity. In the United
States differences of climatic conditions, although giving an almost continuous
production of certain vegetable foods, do not serve to furnish
an uninterrupted supply of fresh products of many staple kinds,
nor are they sufficient to remove the necessity for utilizing the productive
power of the colder regions far beyond the consumptive needs during
the comparatively brief seasons of harvest. The practice of food storage
from the season of natural production through the season of nonproduction
is, of course, to some extent, as old as life itself; but the methods
of preservation have shared in the improvements that have characterized
a modern civilization. And the development of these advanced methods
has brought into the question of food preservation new problems, some
of which it is the purpose in this paper to discuss.</p>

<p>Methods of food preservation may be broadly divided into two classes—first,
those which accomplish their purpose by changing the physical
condition of the food, as by drying, or cooking and hermetical sealing;
and second, those which preserve the articles in such manner that, when
used, they shall be practically in their original condition. The latter
methods depend for their effectiveness upon the provision of such environment
as will check or retard the forces of deterioration or decay, and
it is in the ability to provide such conditions by an artificial control of
temperature and humidity that the preservation of food in apparently
unchanged physical condition has been greatly extended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span></p>

<p>So long as food products were chiefly preserved from the seasons of
production, or maximum production, to the season of nonproduction by
the use of somewhat primitive means, and largely by producers themselves,
or by methods familiar to the household, the food so held was
accepted by the people as a matter of course and recognized necessity.
Canned and dried foods were, and are, used with general satisfaction as
such; and such staple fruits and vegetables as could be carried in their
original condition through the winter months were consumed with a
general knowledge of their age, but with a full appreciation of the necessity
for such holding and of the comparative excellence of the held goods.
Butter and eggs also, when held by producers themselves, even by primitive
and inefficient means, were accepted by consumers in seasons of
natural scarcity with resignation as to their comparatively poor quality
under a general knowledge that nothing better could be expected at
prices within common reach.</p>

<p>These conditions remain unchanged today in respect to those forms
of preserved food whose character is evident either because of their
change of form or because of a popular knowledge that the articles,
though indistinguishable from fresh products, must have been held from
a crop harvested long ago. But the development of preservation by
effective artificial control of temperature has brought some new elements
into the situation.</p>

<p>Cold storage has enlarged the number of food products preservable in
their original condition and created a new industry; it has largely removed
the function of this class of food preservation from the scattered
individual producers to large central establishments and thrown the
business of accumulating and conserving surplus more fully into the
hands of tradesmen. It has permitted the preservation of flesh foods in
a raw state which were never before so preservable; and it has so improved
the quality of stored products whose current production never
ceases entirely that in many cases the held goods cannot be distinguished
from the fresh production.</p>

<p>These facts have led to a popular apprehension that cold storage,
being utilized largely by nonproducers and necessarily upon a speculative
basis, is made a tool for extortion or unjust profits; also that deception
is practiced, in respect to foods whose production never ceases
entirely, by the substitution of stored food for fresh; and exaggerated
statements as to the length of time foods are held in storage have brought
in question their wholesomeness and created a popular prejudice.</p>

<p>It is important to know the facts in these particulars so that the true
function of cold storage in the preservation of food may be understood,
especially because legislative restriction of the industry has been effected
in some States and is under consideration in others, as well as in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
Federal Congress, in the enactment of which mistaken views have resulted
and may further result in public injury.</p>


<p class="center">COLD STORAGE ECONOMICS.</p>

<p>It is a self-evident proposition that, in respect to foods the production
of which is seasonal, the ability to preserve a part of the yield to the
period of nonproduction lessens waste and permits a material increase
of production, thus increasing the available food supply. It is also
evident that, supposing all the food produced to be marketed and consumed,
an increase in the supply of food tends to a lowering of its
average price. Apart from inevitable variations due to climatic conditions
the production of particular foods increases or diminishes according
to the relative profit realized from that production; and it is
evident that a profit sufficient to induce production can be realized upon
a much greater output if the period during which consumption is possible
can be extended. A maximum production of any food can be
realized only when the period of its availability for consumption is constant;
and it follows that the maximum production of foods whose yield
or greatest yield is seasonal, can be realized only by preservation of a
part of the production for use during the season of natural dearth or
deficiency which ends only with the beginning of the following period of
maximum production.</p>

<p>Upon these simple truths rests the economic utility of cold storage
preservation. Practically its benefits in the conservation of food, and
in the encouragement of maximum production, are to be gained only
through the opportunity for profit, and while the business of carrying
foods from seasons of abundance to natural scarcity is open to all it is
naturally conducted chiefly by the tradesmen who are permanently engaged
in food distribution, and who are most familiar with trade conditions
and the varying relations of supply and demand.</p>

<p>An important fact bearing upon the practical use of cold storage
preservation as a feature of the distributing business is that no profit can
be expected by holding products beyond the succeeding period of maximum
production, when prices naturally fall to the lowest point. The
variations in selling prices at that period are never sufficient to cover the
cost of carriage of goods from a previous season and the lessened value
of long stored products in comparison with fresh. There are occasional
market conditions which have induced the holding of perishable foods
in cold storage beyond twelve months in the effort to lessen a loss, but
they are rare and exceptional, so much so that a legal restriction of the
period of permissible holding to twelve months would have very little
effect upon the inducement to utilize cold storage from a commercial
standpoint. But so far as the purely economic interests of consumers
are concerned it would appear that no restriction of the period of permissible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
holding of food in cold storage is either necessary or desirable.
The inducement to hold is profit, and profit can be realized only by selling
into final consumption. And when goods can be carried to a later
date and sold at a higher price it is evidence that the relative scarcity
which results in that higher price would have been more stringent had
the goods not been so carried. In respect to the time of selling stored
foods, therefore, the interests of consumers (as a whole) and of owners of
the food, would seem to be identical; for it is the increased public need
which results in the higher price, and profit, considering storage operations
as a whole, depends upon a correct judgment as to that need.</p>

<p>There seems, therefore, no means by which tradesmen dealing in raw
foods can utilize cold storage preservation for their own benefit at the
cost of a public injury, but that, on the contrary, the profitableness of
holding surplus depends upon the performance of a public service.</p>

<p>The ideal function of cold storage preservation is to carry just such
amount of surplus from the time of greatest yield as can be consumed
during the later period of relative scarcity at just sufficient advance in
value as will cover the cost of carriage and afford a maximum satisfactory
profit for the conduct of the business and the necessary investment
of capital. But it is impossible that this ideal can be uniformly realized.
Even if the operations of storage accumulation and withdrawal
for market were uniformly governed in the light of the fullest possible
knowledge and with the best of judgment, it would be impossible always
to determine the quantity to be stored and the normal price thereof so
that later deficiency at corresponding prices would be exactly offset.
For the extent of later shortage can never be certainly known and the
extent of demand at any particular prices is variable and uncertain.
As a matter of fact, these operations of storage accumulation and later
output, being carried on by thousands of individual and independent
dealers, in the dim light of imperfect knowledge, even as to important
statistical facts that might be known, can never result in ideal effects.
Sometimes the quantity of certain foods stored at the prices paid proves
to be excessive and a part of the surplus, toward the approach of the
next flush season, has to be thrown upon the markets at heavy losses;
sometimes the quantity put away is insufficient to offset the later scarcity
and a part of the surplus, carried late, realizes for larger profits than
normal. But these conditions are, to a large extent, inevitable, and
while they show that the ideal function of cold storage preservation can
not always be realized, they do not materially lessen its value. When a
series of years is considered it will be found that the average profits are
comparatively small in relation to the risks and the investment involved.
And even when, during the flush season of accumulation, prices are sustained
above the normal level by an amount of accumulation that later
proves excessive, consumers get the surplus later at correspondingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
lower prices. The reverse is also true, that when the quantity held is
deficient, leading to relatively high prices in a part of the season of natural
scarcity, a greater previous accumulation, sufficient to prevent so
much advance, would have resulted in higher prices during the previous
flush season.</p>

<p>The view that the economic effect of cold storage is to increase production
and to lower the yearly average price of food whose production
is variable is evidenced by such statistics as are available. In the manufacture
of butter, for instance, the months of greatest production are
from May to August, inclusive, and the months of usual deficiency are
from November to March. In the New York market the average price
of creamery butter from May to August during the period from 1880 to
1892, before cold storage preservation was generally used, was 21.9 cents.
During the same months in the period from 1902 to 1911, when cold
storage facilities were largely available, the average price was 23.4 cents.
But while this comparison shows an average advance of one 1½ cents
during the four months of normal accumulation of surplus the effect
upon prices during the normal season of shortage was very apparent;
for in the months November to March in the period 1880 to 1892 the
average wholesale price was 34.3 cents, while during the same months in
the period from 1902 to 1911 the average for fine fresh creamery was
only 28.9 cents, and the average for fine storage creamery 26.7 cents.</p>


<p class="center">THE QUALITY OF COLD STORED FOODS.</p>

<p>The quality of all perishable food products varies according to the
methods of their production and the care taken of them during transit
from producer to consumer. The more perishable foods, being produced
in a very wide territory by a vast number of producers, and usually
transported over long distances, are found in distributing markets to be
of extremely irregular quality and condition. Usually qualities are best
in the seasons of maximum production, and while goods put into cold
storage are also of irregular quality most of those intended for long
holding are selected, handled and packed with especial care. The effect
upon perishable foods of holding in cold storage is various. It is less in
respect to those carried hard frozen, as meat, fish, poultry and butter,
and upon durable vegetables and fruit, as potatoes and apples, than upon
animal products that cannot be frozen, as eggs in the shell. Yet in all
perishable foods commonly carried in cold storage, quality, as judged by
popular standards, is preservable up to the limit of usual commercial
necessity, in a highly satisfactory degree. The more durable fruits and
vegetables, carried in properly corrected and controlled atmospheric conditions,
after months of holding, are often indistinguishable in point of
quality, from those marketed soon after their harvest. Butter carried
frozen for months loses very little of its original flavor and character.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
Poultry, also, if of fine quality and condition when frozen, may be so held
for a long period without noticeable deterioration. Eggs in cold storage
gradually lose the peculiar freshness of a new laid quality, but under
proper conditions they remain sound, sweet and acceptable when carried
at about 30 degrees temperature for at least nine or ten months. Scientific
investigation conducted by the research laboratories of the United
States Department of Agriculture has given no evidence of any effect of
an unwholesome character upon the quality of perishable foods held in
cold storage up to the limit of usual commercial practice when the products
were sound and wholesome when stored.</p>

<p>The cold storage of surplus and the sale thereof in the markets adds
not at all to the irregularity in quality of our food supply. On the
contrary, the average quality of the supply is improved, for, without
the facility of refrigeration, freshly marketed products would inevitably
be poorer; they are now often poorer than similar goods of much greater
age properly carried in cold storage. Furthermore, the length of time
perishable foods are carried in cold storage is, within reasonable limits,
no criterion of their quality. Perfect products, properly refrigerated
for months, may be, and often are, superior in all the elements of quality
to imperfect goods, freshly marketed or held only a short time. Again,
because of the very widely spread sources of our food supply, the necessity
for collection at innumerable points and transportation over long
distances it is hard to say what goods are “fresh.” Even when collected
at interior points, transported to distant markets and put into consumption
with usual promptness perishable products are often two to four
weeks in the transit from producer to consumer, and often under more
or less unfavorable environments.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it is seriously to be doubted that there is
any real ethical foundation for the recent demand that, in the sale of
perishable foods, there must be a stated distinction between so-called
“fresh” and stored products, or for the feeling that consumers asking
for broiling chickens in the winter, for instance, are deceived if furnished
with acceptable goods frozen six months before. And this doubt is intensified,
no matter how scrupulous we may be in standing for truth and
fair dealing, when it is considered how difficult will be the enforcement
of laws compelling such distinction in commodities of irregular quality
and condition whose age and previous environment cannot be known by
examination, and in respect to which a comparison of quality is often in
favor of the older goods.</p>

<p>The writer’s conclusion from the foregoing considerations, based upon
a long and disinterested observation of the practical use of cold storage
preservation, is that artificial refrigeration furnishes the most important
of all modern factors in the conservation of perishable foods, leading to
an increase in their production, and to a consequent lowering of average<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
prices. Also that governmental attention to the industry would be more
usefully directed toward providing for continuous and frequent statistical
information of the rate of food accumulation and output, to the end
that operators may be guided by the largest possible knowledge,
rather than toward any undue restriction of the industry or the imposition
of costly and difficult requirements which, though seemingly designed
to prevent deception, are, upon analysis, found to be unnecessary
and impractical.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">National Association of Conservation Commissioners</span></h3>
<p class="center"><em>NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONSERVATION COMMISSIONERS.</em></p>

<p>This Association, consisting of Conservation commissioners and other
persons connected with various departments of State development, held
two sessions during the Conservation Congress. Several important subjects
were considered, but most of the time was given to a discussion of
the work done by certain departments connected with public service.</p>

<p>The first session considered State Surveys, their work and co-operation.
As a result of this meeting an agreement was reached as to the
order or sequence of the surveys, the object being to secure for the States
the largest returns from each survey. The sequence of the surveys and
the leading points to be emphasized, as decided by the commissioners, are
as follows: (1) topography, (2) structure, (3) drainage, (4) ground
water, (5) local climate, (6) soil, (7) plant and animal life, (8) social
and industrial conditions. This order is thought to be most helpful so
far as the surveys are concerned. It is also the natural order. It was
plainly shown that several States have wasted time and money in taking
up the various surveys in a way that does not develop these relationships.
For instance, some States have started industrial and agricultural surveys
before they have mapped the geology, topography and water resources.
Such an order does not bring the best results. Furthermore, it
is wasteful.</p>

<p>Several prominent directors of State surveys took part in the discussions
of this session, among them being Dr. George W. Field, Dr. A. H.
Purdue, Dr. F. W. DeWolf, Professor Kay, Dr. C. E. Bessey, Dr. C. H.
Gordon, Dr. Frank W. Rane, Prof. George A. Loveland and Hon. J. E.
Beal. Among the other speakers were Hon. George Coupland, Mr. Ellis,
W. E. Barns, Henry A. Barker, H. E. Hardtner and Dr. H. H. Waite.
Dr. David White, of the United States Geological Survey, gave valuable
suggestions.</p>

<p>At the second session of the commissioners, the forest laws of Louisiana
were discussed by Hon. H. E. Hardtner, ex-Chairman of the Louisiana
Conservation Commission. Following this was a general discussion
of forest laws and forest management. Hon. W. E. Barns, of the Missouri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
Conservation Commission, gave a talk on the improvements of
lumbering in the South. Prof. Earl O. Fippin of the Agricultural College
of Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y., read a paper; subject, “The
Soil Survey as a Means of Agricultural Improvement.” This paper was
followed by discussion, in which the value of the soil surveys as it relates
to State development, was brought out with considerable detail.</p>

<p>The officers elected for the ensuing year were: President, Dr. G. E. Condra,
Lincoln, Neb.; Vice-President, Dr. George W. Field, Sharon,
Mass.; Secretary, Henry A. Barker, Providence, R. I.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Accident Prevention Section</span></h3>
<p class="center"><em>ACCIDENT PREVENTION SECTION.</em></p>

<p>On October 2, 3:30 o’clock, the section on “Accident Prevention”
held a large and enthusiastic meeting in the Auditorium of the German
House. The presiding officer was Mr. M. W. Mix, of Mishawaka, Ind.,
President of the Manufacturers’ Bureau of Indiana. At this meeting
the following resolution was adopted:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Resolved, That we appreciate the efforts now being made by manufacturers
of machinery for use in industrial plants to so far safeguard their machines as
to minimize the danger of personal injury to workers; and that as manufacturers
and individuals interested in accident prevention we recognize the difficulty, and
in some cases even impossibility, on the part of purchasers of individual machines
to properly attach safeguards; and realize that the original manufacturers
of the machines by reason of their wide experience and efficient engineers, are
better able to develop and provide proper safeguards for all machinery; and
that it is the sense of this meeting that any efforts along this line are highly
commendable and will be appreciated by all interested in the Conservation of
human life.</p>

<p>Resolved, further; That a copy of this resolution be sent by the President
to every machine manufacturer with a request for his co-operation.</p>

<p>Report of the Standing Committee on Waters. <span class="smcap">W. C. Mendenhall</span>, Washington,
D. C., Acting Chairman.</p>

<p>To the public the Conservation movement seemed to rise suddenly in
the last few months of 1908 and the early part of the year 1909, but
what the people of the United States was really witnessing then was not
so much the origin of a movement as its organization. Through a generation
before that time Government bureaus, individuals, and associations
here and there had been methodically assembling facts, and those
who were familiar with these facts had been reaching conclusions that
were oftentimes disturbing in their tenor. These individuals and groups
were brought together, their conclusions were given publicity of a most
effective type, and what had been scattered and disorganized recognition
of a vital problem was given solidarity and nation-wide recognition by
the acts of President Roosevelt and Gifford Pinchot in organizing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</span>
National Conservation Commission and calling the Conference of Governors.
The Forest Service, the Reclamation Service, and the Geological
Survey had locked up in their archives the results of decades of
research by their representatives, and these results supplied the facts
which were the stimulus and the basis for the Conservation movement.
Since that first great meeting, the Conservation Congress, giving official
expression to the movement and formulating its doctrines and its platform,
has served as a medium for the exchange of ideas among those
who are engaged in one or the other of its manifold activities, for the
subject-matter of Conservation is as comprehensive as the materials with
which humanity deals. Furthermore, the term itself has been impressed
upon the public mind. It has passed out of the category of a cult for
the few, and has been taken up by statesmen and politicians, scientists
and divines, commercial organizations, manufacturing associations, and
has even invaded the realm of diplomacy. This proves merely that the
seeds were well sown by those who were sponsors for the movement.
Their work, the task of focusing public attention upon a theretofore neglected
but vital series of problems, was superlatively well done.</p>

<p>Years have passed since that time. It is appropriate that we review
the results of those years as it was appropriate in 1908 to make our first
inventory of the primary subject-matter of Conservation, namely, our
natural resources. The period of initiation, difficult but well performed,
is past. There remains a task that will never be finished—the equally
difficult and the infinitely slower process of applying the principles of
Conservation to our every-day activities. Such an application must be
practical, reasonable, and gradual so that modes of life and industrial
habits in which change is to be affected can be given time and opportunity
to adjust to that change. How well have we, the workers in the
ranks for these principles, performed our task? In what fashion has
the movement been carried on? What real and creative steps have been
taken in the public interest to reserve for future generations without
unnecessary suppression of opportunity for the individual in the present
or denial of his needs, that share in our natural wealth which should
be so reserved?</p>

<p>I shall confine myself to a brief and casual review of that phase of
the Conservation movement which deals with the one resource—water.
Even in dealing with this one item in the subject-matter of Conservation,
I shall have to leave aside for treatment by others, and indeed by other
organizations than this, that phase of the problem of the waters which
deals primarily with transportation and its allied problems of river improvement
and waterway construction. There still remains a broad
field, for water is the universal resource. Doctor McGee has estimated
that the ultimate control of population in the United States will be exerted
by the limitations in its water supply. We cannot say that this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
limit in population, even though it be placed at from five hundred to
one thousand million people, is one that does not concern this generation,
for we feel very keenly now in our arid and semi-arid sections the
handicap which lack of water places upon our growth. Irrigation and
dry-farming methods are attempts to overcome this handicap and forces
us to realize that the ultimate growth predicted by Dr. McGee can be
reached only through the most careful husbanding of the most universal
and important gift of nature—water.</p>

<p>Because the human body, like all other organic structures, is largely
water and because all of its nutritive and renewing processes are exercised
by the function of water as the solvent of other foods, it has a
primary value to man superior to that of any other substance. Its secondary
value, scarcely less important than the primary and closely related
to it in character, is as an aid in the production of nearly all things
which man uses. In the humid regions, the supply is sufficient naturally
so that the necessity of water is ordinarily given no more thought than
the necessity for air, although without either we should instantly perish.
Man’s use of water in crop production, hence, is automatic and unconscious
in the eastern United States, but in western part, and especially
in the arid districts, he at once becomes conscious of its importance because
plans and crops fail without it. He establishes engineering works
and conducts it to the land in order that food may be grown upon the
land. Here, in the pioneer stages of settlement, comes the first great
waste. Water was and too frequently still is carelessly used in irrigation.
An equivalent of twenty or twenty-five feet in depth has been
applied annually to the land where four or five feet is ample. The excess
is sheer waste and in its application the land is ruined. Canals are
often carelessly constructed and half of their carrying capacity leaks out
before the tract to be irrigated is reached.</p>

<p>As settlement increases and demand becomes more intense, these conditions
are improved. Their improvement in our own arid West and
Southwest began under the pressure of necessity before the Conservation
movement was given a name, but that improvement nonetheless represented
the application of Conservation principles and the movement centered
attention upon this and similar wastes, made men more generally
conscious of them, and stimulated preventive measures. This stimulus,
acting upon the public mind, aided many of the Government bureaus that
for years had been combating such waste. The Department of Agriculture
has a Bureau of Irrigation Investigations, which has systematically
studied irrigation methods in the West and Southwest and has
published many valuable reports calling attention to the losses of water
in irrigation and suggesting methods for its prevention. The Geological
Survey in its series of water-supply papers has repeatedly warned communities
of the injuries and economic waste resulting from bad management<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
of water supplies. The Reclamation Service, represented in its
foundation a branch of Conservation, established and made a practical
working idea. Since its foundation it has systematically continued the
great work begun by the passage of its organic act in 1902, and is
reclaiming, by careful and economic methods, millions of otherwise waste
acres in the public land States. It has reached the point where the
building of impounding reservoirs and of the canals by which the impounded
water is conducted to the lands has been brought to practical
completion on many of the projects so that its task is transformed into
one of inducing settlement, of inculcating principles of economic irrigation
practice in the minds of the farmers; of increasing the duty of water
and therefore its usefulness, to the maximum; and of reclaiming through
the establishment of drainage systems, lands which have been ruined by
over-irrigation under the old systems absorbed by the reclamation
projects. This movement is a part of, has aided, and has in turn been
aided by the propaganda. It is practical Conservation of a high type.</p>

<p>I should like to diverge here for a moment to a collateral phase of
Conservation activity which indirectly bears upon reclamation by irrigation.
Our coal land laws provide for the sale of those parts of the
public domain underlain by coal deposits at prices of not less than $10 or
$20 per acre. Prior to 1906, this law was interpreted as evaluating coal
lands on the basis of the thickness, quality and depths of individual beds,
and basing sale prices upon these values. Through the fruition of this
policy, coal lands are no longer sold at the minimum legal price unless
they have minimum values. If coals are of sufficiently good quality and
exist in sufficient thickness, they may now be sold at $40, $50, $100, $200,
or even $500 per acre. A recent sale in the Rock Springs district,
Wyoming, of one section of land at prices ranging from $370 to $410 per
acre, netted the Government one quarter of a million dollars more than
would have been received under the old policy of sales at minimum
prices. This increment of a quarter million goes, like all other receipts
from sales of public lands, into the reclamation fund and is there used
in the application of water to the arid lands in the West. The Conservation
phase of the present coal land policies is thus closely related
to the question of waters and their use. The valuation of this natural
resource and the sale at valuation prices was one of the collateral movements
which stimulated and led to public recognition of the need of
Conservation. It is a thoroughly practical application of Conservation
principles and is an excellent example of governmental activity in this
direction.</p>

<p>In one of the arid valleys of southern California in which irrigated
lands bring prices of from $500 to $3,000 per acre and in which the limit
to the number of acres to which such values are affixed depends wholly
upon the quantity of water available, there has of course been earnest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</span>
study of every possible means by which this quantity could be increased
or made to serve a larger acreage. Here, in 1909, an interesting, practical
step in Conservation was taken. Prior to that period water users
in this valley who derive an important part of their supply from underground
resources which, because of excessive drafts, were becoming
depleted, had adopted the unique device of spreading flood waters which
would otherwise escape to the sea and be lost, over the rough alluvial
lands at the base of the mountain slopes in order that they might there
sink and replenish the underground resources. The lands best adapted
to this purpose had remained public lands because of their rough and
uncultivable character, although adjacent to them were privately owned
lands worth many hundreds of dollars per acre. In 1909 a law was
passed by which these public lands were set aside for use in the distribution
of these flood waters. They are now, and will remain, a permanent
public reserve devoted to the conservation of water supplies and the
increase of the quantity available for irrigation in a region in which
water for this purpose has perhaps a higher value than in any other
part of the United States. Here again is an example of practical Conservation
work accomplished through the co-operation of private and
governmental agencies.</p>

<p>The passage of the so-called Weeks bill in 1911 likewise marks a
great advance in the direction of Conservation legislation. This is the
bill which provides for the creation of an Appalachian forest reserve
by the purchase of privately owned lands in the Appalachian Mountains.
Its administration is in the hands of a commission whose active agents
are the Forest Service and the Geological Survey, and one of the features
of the bill is the clause which provides that the Geological Survey must
affirm that the purchase of the lands will favorably affect the navigability
of the streams on whose headwaters they lie, before the purchase can
be made. Thus the conservation of waters is involved as well as that of
the forests and of lands through the prevention of erosion. Those of
you who for years advocated such a bill and assisted in its final enactment
will agree with me, I believe, in the statement that its passage
would not have been possible without the preliminary education of public
opinion accomplished by the great pioneer advocates of the Conservation
principles.</p>

<p>There is and will continue to be need for revision of the laws under
which the administrative officers of the Government work to the end
that these officers may administer our public resources more economically,
more effectively, with less waste and therefore more thoroughly in
the public interest. The enactment of laws does not anticipate the need
for their enactment. There must always be widespread recognition of
that need before public opinion crystallizes into statute. For, after all,
the enactment of a law is nothing more nor less than the recognition on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
the part of our lawmakers of a public necessity which you and I as citizens
force upon their attention. Until new laws can be secured, the task
of the administrative officer is to administer with the greatest efficiency
possible those laws that do exist. Under the stimulus of an active public
opinion an interpretation may be given old laws which will enable them
to fit the newer and changed conditions, for no enactment is absolutely
rigid in its terms. An example of this adaptation of a law long upon
our statute books to the passing of pioneer conditions in the West and
the substitution for them of those changed conditions that result from
augmented population, is that of the coal land law to which your attention
has been called. The statute has not been altered since its passage
in 1873, but coal lands are being sold under it now at prices which are
based upon real values instead of at the lowest possible price under the
law, as was true prior to 1906.</p>

<p>Under the stimulus of the changed character of public opinion, which
has resulted from Conservation agitation, all of our public land laws are
being carefully scrutinized to determine whether they do not admit of
an interpretation and of an administration that is more in consonance
with Conservation principles than the interpretation and administration
of the past. Among the statutes thus scrutinized is the Carey Act, a
law only less vital to the West than the Reclamation Act. In general it
provides that public lands may be transferred by the Federal Government
to the State in which they lie if that State will enter into a contract
for their irrigation, by the terms of which they will eventually be
delivered to bona fide homesteaders in tracts of suitable size. Undoubtedly,
there have been instances in the past of careless administration of
this law. The Federal Government has considered that its responsibility
to the settler had ceased when the lands were turned over to the State
in trust to him. The State, in turn, has considered that its responsibility
ceased when the contract with the irrigating company was signed,
and this company has been left free to deal with its actual and prospective
settlers in a fashion that was intended too frequently to bring
profits to a promoting company rather than water upon arid lands. It
has thus happened that settlers, depending upon the State and through
the State upon the Federal Government for protection of their interests,
have found when the time came to apply for patents to their lands that
although they had paid to a company large sums for water supplies,
the water was not delivered, the land could not be reclaimed as the law
required, and they were therefore unable to secure patent to it; but the
irrigating or promoting company to which their funds had gone had disappeared
and was inaccessible under the law. The genuine farmer, who
at the sacrifice of hard-earned funds and years of labor was intended to
be the beneficiary of this law, became instead its victim. This condition
is believed to be past. The Federal Government and many of the States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
are now exhibiting a keen recognition of their responsibilities and of
scrutinizing with the utmost care the water supply of each proposed
project, the practicability of the engineering features of that project, and
the financial standing and responsibility of its backers. A recent interesting
example of this changed attitude occurred in one of the Western
States, which in the past has administered this law carelessly, but I am
glad to record is now exhibiting due care in meeting its responsibilities.
In this case, literature issued by the promoters came to the attention of
the Department of the Interior. In this literature statements were made
to prospective buyers as to the available water supply and as to the
acreage to which it would be applied that were known from the departmental
records to be highly misleading. The attention of the Governor
of the State was called to this condition of affairs by an emphatic letter
from the Secretary of the Interior. The State in turn called upon the
promoting company for an explanation. The representatives of the
company hastened to Washington for a hearing. As a result of that
hearing, the acreage segregated in the project was promptly reduced, the
company was forced to agree to cease its sale of water rights to private
lands until the rights of the Government lands to which it was inviting
settlers were satisfied, and thus the situation so full of menace to prospective
settlers was promptly corrected. Other examples of this type of
action which represents closer, more careful administration of old laws
might be multiplied. Each of them marks a step in the application of
the principles for which the Conservation Congress stands.</p>

<p>If the first use of water by man is in the direct sustenance of life and
its second is for the production of food supplies through irrigation, perhaps
its third most important use is the development of power for all of
those manifold purposes tending toward the amelioration of life and the
increase of its comforts, for which power may be used. Cities are lighted;
street cars are moved; ores are smelted; manufacturing plants are supplied
with their motive power; homes are heated; and water is pumped
for irrigation by the use of hydro-electric power. No question has been
the subject of more bitter controversy than that of the control of this
tremendous resource. It has been energetically sought on the one hand
by those who seek opportunities for profit and desire that no control be
exercised over those opportunities by the power of the State. On the
other hand, public opinion, working largely through its State and Federal
representatives, has demanded that this resource whose magnitude
can be but rudely estimated, and whose future value but guessed at, be so
controlled that communities depending upon it shall not be unduly taxed
for the purpose of piling up private profits. Here again, both public
opinion and Federal officers have repeatedly urged the enactment of new
laws which will make possible the exercise of reasonable control in the
public interests and at the same time properly safeguard capital which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
must be invested in order that the resources now wasted may develop
and become useful. Bills have been introduced and debated in Congress;
conferences have been held with representatives of the public and
of capital, but the plans thus far considered have brought no fruition in
amended legislation, although some excellent bills are under consideration
and it is believed will soon become law. Here again, the task of the
administrative officer is to so interpret and apply the laws now upon our
statute books, pending the enactment of others more satisfactory, that
development may continue and the rights of the public of this generation
and the next be at the same time duly safeguarded. Here also there
has been progress in the interpretation of law. The responsibility for
the administration of the laws for the development of water powers in
the national forests lies in the Forest Service where it is admirably exercised
in the public interest. The law which provides for the development
of powers on the public domain, whether within or without the
reserves, is a permissory law, one that authorizes the department having
jurisdiction to permit the development of these water powers under
general regulations to be fixed by the Secretary. After a thorough
study of the situation, the Forest Service on December 28, 1910, issued
certain regulations providing for the development of powers under this
permissory law, the permit being by the terms of the law itself subject to
cancellation at any time and the regulations under it providing for
moderate charges upon the developing company. With these regulations
in force in the national forests, and no similar procedure provided for
on the public lands outside the forests which are under the jurisdiction
of the Interior Department, applicants for the privilege of developing
water powers which lay in part within and in part without the forest
reserves found themselves under two jurisdictions without any provision
for uniform procedure. The problem as to the precise amount of
control that could be exercised on the Interior Department lands under
the act of 1901 has not been solved until recently; but as a result of this
final solution, there were approved by Secretary Fisher on the 24th of
August, 1912, regulations controlling the issue of permits for power
development outside of the national forests that are in substantial accord
with those heretofore in force within the forests. These regulations
provide for the exercise of the authority of the Secretary in a definite,
uniform, and systematic manner that much more fully safeguards the
rights of the public than the policy heretofore pursued in relation to
public water powers. The situation, therefore, seems to be as well safeguarded
as it can be under the present statutes, at least so far as hydro-electric
powers on other than navigable streams are concerned, and this
end has been accomplished not by new legislation, which we all recognize
as badly needed, but by a proper interpretation and acceptance of responsibility
under old legislation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span></p>

<p>An incidental phase of the effort to administer a law which provides
for no definite tenure of lands having power values has been the constantly
repeated attempt of interests desiring to acquire valuable water
powers to secure them under the irrigation laws, those laws having great
advantage from the commercial viewpoint of providing for a grant
instead of a revocable permit. Application after application has been
filed with the Department of the Interior in which it is stated solemnly
that the rights of way are desired for purposes of irrigation, when it is
perfectly obvious to the engineering advisers of the Secretary that the
power value is the dominant value and that if the waters are used for
irrigation at all, it will be merely in order to effect a technical compliance
with the law under which they are acquired. Refusal to approve
rights of way of this type have been followed by appeals and by emphatic
protests on the part of the applicants. These protests take various
forms. Among them are attempts to influence public opinion through
various congresses similar to this Congress, and other attempts to secure
the enactment of special legislation which will grant to the applicant that
which he is unable to secure through the administrative officers. In a
particularly interesting case of this type recently acted upon by the Department
of the Interior, the acting Secretary expressed the present
policy of the department in these emphatic terms, which I am sure will
appeal to every member of this Congress. He said:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>I consider it the imperative duty of every supervisory officer of the Government
upon whom any duty devolves to conserve the paramount interests of the
people, to protect these natural power sites from exploitation under any law
which successfully invoked would turn them over to private interests charged
with a perpetual easement against the United States.</p>
</div>

<p>One other type of administrative action in connection with the conservation
of water resources has recently been inaugurated which may
well be brought to the attention of this Congress. This is a new exercise
by the President of the power of withdrawal conferred upon him
by the so-called withdrawal act, approved June 25, 1910, and amended
August 24, 1912. By this action those lands in arid States upon which
small water supplies essential to the control of the adjoining range are
situated are withheld from entry. Those of you who are acquainted
with the range industry of Wyoming, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico
realize that the use and control of the ranges are exercised not so much
through the ownership of the range lands themselves as through the
ownership of small tracts which include the springs and other watering
places that alone make the ranges accessible and of value. Literal war
has been waged between rival stock interests in parts of the West over
the control of springs. Large interests have frequently forced their
rivals to abandon the range in a particular area by acquiring through
the application of scrip or by a real or pretended exercise of homestead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
rights the lands on which the springs that alone give value to the range
are located. Laws have from time to time been considered which will
provide properly for the disposition of those remaining parts of the
public domain that are chiefly valuable for grazing purposes. It is
recognized that the homestead and desert land laws are inappropriate for
the acquisition of range lands in that they do not provide for a sufficient
acreage to make the stock industry possible. If the time shall come
when such a law is placed upon the statute books, and at that time all
of the water supplies adjacent to the ranges shall have been acquired by
private interests, the Government will be unable to dispose of its range
lands even under a favorable law except to those who already control
the water supplies which are the key to the situation. Recognizing this
important condition and desiring likewise to provide for fair play between
rival stock men on the remaining public lands, the President, upon
the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, has inaugurated the
policy of withholding from entry lands upon which these desert watering
places exist, and in pursuance of this policy the first desert water
hole withdrawal was made in March, 1912.</p>

<p>It will be realized from this brief review that the process of translating
the Conservation doctrines into action is well under way. Before
and since the First Conservation Congress met, Federal bureaus have
advocated practical measures for the proper use of our natural resources,
water among them. With the enlightenment of public opinion dating
from the organization of the National Commission and the meeting of
the Governors the work has been greatly facilitated. It is advancing
now not only through the medium of the unorganized effort of individuals,
associations, and isolated bureaus and divisions in the public service,
but by the organized efforts of an enthusiastic body of supporters.
Laws embodying its principles have passed, proposed laws inimical to
those principles have been defeated, old laws have been re-examined and
reinterpreted to accord more fully with Conservation doctrines in the
public interests. Party platforms are no longer complete without a
Conservation plank and indeed it may almost be said that a new party
has been founded upon the Conservation idea. On the whole the country
and this Congress have ample ground for optimism in considering
the great advance that has been made.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Report, Standing Committee on Wild Life Protection</span></h3>
<p class="center"><em>WILD LIFE PROTECTION.</em></p>
</div>
<p class="center">Report of Standing Committee, Dr. <span class="smcap">W. T. Hornaday</span>, New York City, Chairman.</p>

<p>The Committee on Wild Life Protection wishes to call the attention
of the Congress to the enormous losses that are being inflicted upon the
farming and fruit-growing interests of the United States through the
destruction of insect-eating birds. While the main facts of the situation
are known to many persons, the mass of the people of the United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
are sound asleep on this subject. The 5,000,000 men and boys who are
slaughtering our birds are levying tribute on every American pocketbook.
An immense number of birds of great economic value are being slaughtered
annually, and many of our most useful and valuable bird species
are on the toboggan slide toward extermination. The destruction of our
insect-eating birds means a great increase in the armies of destructive
insects, a great decrease in our agricultural products, and a great loss to
consumers and to farmers. The value of the birds destroyed as “game”
and for “food” is declared to be not equal to one-thousandth of the
value they would save to the national wealth, if permitted to live.</p>

<p>The committee will distribute a campaign circular containing a table
of figures showing the annual losses to the people of the United States
by insect pests. Those figures were taken from an official report published
in the “Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture.” The farmers
who grow cereal crops lose about $200,000,000 per annum. The
fruit-growers lose $27,000,000 per annum. Hay loses $53,000,000; cotton,
$60,000,000; and truck crops, $53,000,000.</p>

<p>The committee’s circular gives the cost of certain insects per species
to the people of the United States. For example, the codling moth and
curculio apple pests cost the American people $8,250,000 a year for
spraying operations, and $12,000,000 per year in annual shrinkage in
the apple crop. The chinch bug wheat pest sometimes costs $20,000,000
per year, and the cotton boll weevil the same amount. The tree insect
pests damage trees and timber to a total of $100,000,000 a year.</p>

<p>Your committee contends that the American people <em>do not realize</em>
that scores of species of the birds that sportsmen and pot-hunters are
regularly allowed to shoot for sport are of <em>immense value</em> to agriculture.
How many men are there out of every thousand who know that at least
thirty species of shore birds feed upon noxious insects, and are immensely
valuable to our agricultural industries? The gunners who
shoot legally are destroying 154 species of birds that legally are classed
as game birds, even in the North.</p>

<p>Very few Americans out of every thousand know the <em>immense value</em>
of our song birds, swallows, woodpeckers, blackbirds, quail, doves and
nighthawks in destroying countless millions of noxious insects.</p>


<p class="center">THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION.</p>

<p>In view of the decrease already accomplished in the general volume of
the bird life of America, in view of the enormous losses annually inflicted
upon the people of this country by the ravages of insects, and in view of
the destruction of wild life that now is furiously proceeding throughout
all America, the McLean bill, now before Congress, to provide Federal
protection for all migratory birds, becomes the most important wild life
measure that ever came before the Congress of the United States in any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
form. In view of the annual losses to the wealth of this country that
will continue so long as the McLean bill fails to pass, it is impossible for
any one to put forth one good reason, unless it be on purely technical
grounds, against that measure. By the inexorable logic of the situation,
any man who opposes the enactment of a law for the Federal protection
of migratory birds becomes by that opposition an enemy to the public
welfare. The bills introduced in Congress by Representatives Weeks
and Anthony have dragged long enough. They provided for the protection
of migratory <em>game</em> birds, only. Now it is time to strengthen their
proposition, as Senator McLean has done, by providing also for the protection
of all the migratory insectivorous birds.</p>

<p>Unless the people of America wish to shut their eyes to their own
interests, and pay out millions of dollars annually in the form of increased
cost of living, they should arouse from their lethargy and put up
to Congress such a demand for the passage of the McLean bill that it
will be enacted into law at the next session of Congress. It is Senate
Bill No. 6497, and on the Senate calendar it is No. 606. We can not
afford to wait until 1914 or 1915; and Congress has full power to act
next winter.</p>

<p>How many people in the North know that the negroes and poor
whites of the South annually slaughter millions of valuable insect-eating
birds for food? Around Avery Island, Louisiana, during the robin
season (in January when the berries are ripe), Mr. E. A. McIlhenny
says that during ten days or two weeks, at least 10,000 robins are each
day slaughtered for the pot. “Every negro man and boy who can raise
a gun is after them!”</p>

<p>There are seven States in which the robin is regularly and legally
being killed as game! They are Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland, North
Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Florida.</p>

<p>There are five States that expressly permit the killing of blackbirds
as “game”: Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee, District of Columbia,
Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Cranes are killed and eaten in Colorado, Nevada, Nebraska, North
Dakota and Oklahoma.</p>

<p>In twenty-six States doves are regularly killed as game—much to the
loss of the farmers.</p>

<p>The bobwhite quail is a great destroyer of the seeds of noxious weeds.
In our fauna he has no equal. And yet this fact is ignored. Throughout
the North and most of the South that species is mercilessly shot, and
as a result it is fast <em>becoming extinct</em>. In New York State it will soon
be as extinct as the mastodon, unless given a ten-year close season at
once. Its value as a plentiful game bird is gone.</p>

<p>The shore birds are <em>fast</em> becoming exterminated by sportsmen and
pot-hunters who kill them for food, “according to law.” The Eskimo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
curlew is totally extinct, and other species are fast going over the same
road. Nothing in this world will save this group of birds except <em>a law
for the Federal protection of migratory birds</em>, such as the McLean bill,
now before Congress. The way the whole group of shore birds is being
exterminated is nothing less than a crime. And yet, at least thirty
members of this group are of a great value to all of us, because of the
great numbers of crop-destroying insects that they annually consume.</p>


<p class="center">THE DUTY OF THE HOUR.</p>

<p>The <em>only way</em> in which all these valuable migratory birds can be saved
to us is through the strong arm of the National Government, and a Federal
law for the protection of <em>all</em> migratory birds! Protection of game
birds alone will not answer. Too many other birds are being killed for
food, especially in the South.</p>

<p>The Wild Life Protection Committee urges all delegates to take home
with them the burden that rests on every good citizen regarding the
enactment into law of a satisfactory measure for the preservation of the
insect-eating birds. If any opposition should arise on account of the
feature of the bill which covers the ducks, geese and swans, and other
migratory wild fowl, the committee is quite willing that those birds
should be stricken out of the bill entirely, in order that the protection of
the crop-saving birds may be secured. It is believed that no sensible
person can possibly raise any objection to the protection of the insectivorous
birds by the passage of the McLean or Weeks bill, in case the
water fowl are left out. It is, however, regarded as extremely necessary
that the shore birds should be included because of their immense value
to agriculture.</p>

<p>In concluding, the committee urges all delegates to take this matter
up with your members of Congress, and urge them to vote for, and work
for, whatever bill may finally be agreed upon as best calculated to protect
the insectivorous birds, and be free from objections regarding its
constitutionality. A number of able lawyers have decided that it will
be wholly within the spirit and letter of the Constitution of the United
States for the Federal Government to protect all insectivorous birds
through a law of Congress.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Vital Resources of the Nation”</span></h3>
<p class="center"><em>VITAL RESOURCES OF THE NATION.</em></p>

<p class="center">Dr. <span class="smcap">Henry Sturgis Drinker</span>, President of Lehigh University, a Delegate from
the State of Pennsylvania, from Lehigh University, and from
the American Forestry Association.</p>

<p>What subject is there to which the constant attention of Conservationists,
of patriotic men and women, could be better devoted than to
the care of the vital resources of the nation—the care of the lives of all
our people, not of a selected few, the teaching and the impressing of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
lessons of steady life, of sobriety, of continence, and of due rest and recuperation
from the wear and tear of our American life. Surely we
have good reason to be proud of the intelligence and activity of our
people, formed as they are of the intermingling of many peoples, with a
resulting product as a nation that is markedly free from in-breeding
and its usually unsatisfactory outcome.</p>

<p>I think it was Mr. Lieber, in the course of his gracious and cordial
opening address of welcome to the Congress, who referred to our duty
to endeavor to alleviate the condition of the sweat-shop and mine workers,
but is there not another and equally great duty of which we are
habitually more neglectful? What is our duty, the duty of society, to
those self-sacrificing, altruistic men, devoted to public service, men such
as Dr. Wallace, Mr. White, Mr. Farquhar, who devote themselves to and
ably lead great movements like this Congress for the betterment of conditions
among our people—men who are not only captains of industry,
but generals in the army of public service, and leaders and exemplars
in the pursuit of public duty? What should we, as a body, say to them
and to others like them (for, thank God, America owns a great army of
good men like them), who uphold the good cause of public service? They
become in leading these great movements, in a measure, the custodians of
the public welfare, but—“Quis custodiet ipsos custodes”? Who shall
watch these very guards, and see that they conserve the intelligence,
patriotism and energy, that goes out from them to public welfare, that
it may not be prematurely exhausted? Surely we should take measures
to have them feel how the Nation values them as a public asset, and how
they owe it to their country as well as to their homes to heed and to
preach to others the wise words of dear old Mark Twain, who (writing
from Naples in 1867) sent us these words, pregnant with the lesson of
the higher Conservation:</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>“We walked up and down one of the most popular streets for some time,
enjoying other people’s comfort, and wishing we could export some of it to our
restless, driving, vitality-consuming marts at home. Just in this one matter lies
the main charm of life in Europe—comfort. In America, we hurry—which is
well; but when the day’s work is done, we go on thinking of losses and gains,
we plan for the morrow, we even carry our business cares to bed with us, and
toss and worry over them when we ought to be restoring our racked bodies and
brains with sleep. We burn up our energies with these excitements, and either
die early, or drop into a mean and lean old age, at a time of life which they call
a man’s prime in Europe. When an acre of ground has produced long and well,
we let it lie fallow and rest for a season; we take no man clear across the continent
in the same coach he started in—the coach is stabled somewhere on the
plains and its heated machinery allowed to cool for a few days; when a razor has
seen long service and refuses to hold an edge, the barber lays it aside for a few
weeks, and the edge comes back of its own accord. We bestow thoughtful care
upon inanimate objects, but none upon ourselves. What a robust people, what
a nation of thinkers we might be, if we would only lay ourselves on the shelf
occasionally and renew our edges.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span></p>

<p>As the official call for this Congress stated, we have in previous
meetings dealt with four great subjects—our forests, waters, lands, and
minerals, but in taking for its theme this year the subject of “Vital
Resources,” the Congress is studying the very life of the Nation, is
seeking to benefit our people not only by the conservation of our material
natural resources, but to do good to them by bringing home the duty
of life Conservation in our whole Nation; and what greater task can
patriotic men and women devote themselves to than this, and what words
can epitomize the sentiment underlying this service better than those in
Sophocles’ “Oedipus,” where it is said:</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Paper, “Conservation of the Soil”</span></h3>
<p class="center"><em>CONSERVATION OF THE SOIL.</em></p>

<p class="center">Hon. <span class="smcap">James J. Hill</span>, of St. Paul, Minn.</p>

<p>Just as all industry depends upon the production and increase of
the fruits of the earth, so all other forms of Conservation must be held
subordinate to the preservation of the productivity of the soil. To
preserve and defend the public health, to see that human beings are
brought into the world and kept there under favoring conditions, and
to lengthen their term of life will but add to the total of human misery
unless they are well fed and housed and clothed. For this, as for the
material of all their varied activities, they must come back in the last
analysis to the soil. Earth is the mother not only of mankind but of all
human industry.</p>

<p>In the years during which the necessity of this most imperative form
of Conservation has been the subject of my thought and the theme of
most of my public utterances, much has been accomplished. The interest
of the public is awake. It is not necessary any longer to urge a
Conservation movement, but rather to direct the energy already enlisted
in its behalf into wise channels. While the farmer is still subject to
some unfavorable legislative discrimination, we know that his prosperity
must be made a first object before prosperity can visit others. The
progress of the farm is put first in many schemes of public improvement
where, a few years ago, it would have been mentioned perfunctorily if
at all.</p>

<p>Education in agriculture has made much progress. The number of
institutions teaching agriculture increased more than sixty per cent. in
nineteen months. They had ten per cent. more students in agriculture
in 1910 than in 1909, and more than eight times as many students taking
the teachers’ course in agriculture. Colleges and high schools give place
to some form of agricultural instruction; and the necessity of fostering
soil Conservation is recognized today as never before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span></p>

<p>What we need to do at once belongs rather to the practical than to
the theoretical side of Conservation. There is little reason to doubt
that the farmer of the future should be a highly intelligent man, commanding
from his acres crops that are far beyond those of today in their
abundance. But the present generation may and should do far better
for itself, in its own time, while it is also preparing the way for the
more careful and productive agriculture which should follow.</p>

<p>I use intentionally the words “careful” and “productive” instead of
the word “scientific,” as applied to soil treatment and crop raising,
because they express the simple and easy processes within the reach of
men of the present generation as well as the new; because they avoid a
misleading implication that attaches to the word “scientific.” It is
true that the best methods of soil treatment and crop growing are scientific;
but they require only that form of popular science which is within
the comprehension and use of every farmer.</p>

<p>The essentials of soil Conservation have been known for centuries.
They were practiced in Babylonia, just as irrigation was resorted to
there on a splendid scale. They have been the property of the Chinese
for four thousand years, and maintained there a dense population in
spite of croppings so frequent and severe that it would seem impossible
for any soil to stand such treatment without exhaustion. The latest
bulletin of the best agricultural institution is scarcely more instructive
or helpful than a study of the “forty centuries of agriculture” included
in the experience of these skilled and laborious people of the Orient.</p>

<p>The soil is a living thing, and must receive the treatment due to all
organic and vital beings from which we expect service or tribute. The
first requisite is that the individual man learn with what manner of
soil he is dealing. There is now an agricultural college or experiment
station within the reach of every farmer in the country. Some are and
all should be equipped for a scientific analysis of all soils submitted to
them. From this the cultivator may learn the first two things indispensable
to any intelligent conduct of his industry: First, to what crops
his land is best adapted; second, what elements of fertility have been
drawn from it so lavishly that they need to be restored. This information
having been given by competent authority, every farmer may do
all the rest for himself.</p>

<p>There is no secret and no mystery about the processes involved. If
farmers will rotate their crops, fertilize plentifully and intelligently,
keep live stock to diversify their industry, refresh the land and utilize
waste products, and cultivate thoroughly and frequently, the problem
of soil Conservation is solved. The earth has been kept as productive for
thousands of years as it was when it produced its first crop of cultivated
cereals wherever these few and simple conditions have been observed. If
seed is carefully selected, after a test for germination, and the practices<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
mentioned are followed, there is no reason why the yield per acre of the
principal crops of the United States should not equal those of England,
Germany or many other countries which produce twice as much as we do
with far inferior natural advantages.</p>

<p>Dr. Knapp, of the Department of Agriculture, said: “It has been
found that the best seed bed added 100 per cent. to the average crop on
similar lands, with an average preparation; planting the best seed made
a gain of 50 per cent.; and shallow, frequent cultivation was equal to
another 50 per cent., making a total gain of 200 per cent., or a crop three
times the average. With better teams and implements, this crop is made
at less cost per acre.” A bulletin of the Bureau of Plant Industry, at
Washington, says: “It is possible within a few years to double the average
production of corn per acre in the United States, and to accomplish
it without any increase in work or expense.” It declares that twice
twenty-six bushels, which is about what we now get, is a fair crop where
these conditions are observed, three times twenty-six bushels a good crop
and four times twenty-six bushels frequently produced. A similar increase
in other farm growths is just as possible.</p>

<p>In a high sense this is conservation of the soil, because it shows the
way to make one acre do the work of two or three or four. It is conservation
of the soil in a still better sense, because the land, when so
intelligently and considerately treated, instead of “wearing out,” not
only maintains its productive power indefinitely but actually increases
in fertility and value. These are facts which all history attests. They
are facts which the most recent scientific research supports. The work
before the promoters of the Conservation movement today is one not of
discovery but of education. It is to assist in bringing home the truth to
the minds and embodying it in the daily practice of the present farm
population of the United States.</p>

<p>This tremendous task can be accomplished only by local demonstration
and the force of practical example. Small model farms should be
operated, preferably consisting of a few acres selected from ordinary
neighborhood farms and treated intelligently, in every State, county and
township. We have made a beginning of this work in the Northwest;
and the results, though not yet completely enough ascertained for tabulation
until the tale of threshing and marketing is ended, are as amazing
as they are encouraging. Some of the States are providing for traveling
instructors and supervisors in agriculture, following the policy
successfully adopted in the most enlightened countries of Europe, thus
raising the level of agricultural practice and educating the millions who
are beyond the reach of the institutions where formal instruction is
given to the young. It is imperative that we reach the older people, and
the large percentage of the children of the farm who never get beyond
the district school, if we are in earnest in the work we have undertaken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</span></p>

<p>To this practical side of soil Conservation this Congress should give
its hearty approval. It should urge upon the people of every community
the adoption of the demonstration tract and the local instructor,
with as much earnestness as it has championed the saving of forests and
the reclamation of arid lands. Ten per cent. of the money now expended
in formal instruction in the institutions where agriculture is
taught, or supposed to be taught, would put every farmer in touch
with the man who could and should help him in the treatment of his
land as readily and surely as the doctor helps his family when they are
sick. It would be more than repaid every year in the value of the crop
increase. It would be repaid over again in the healing of sick soils, the
renovation of old lands, the preservation undiminished in every acre of
our arable area of those elements of fertility without which plant life
languishes, and the wilderness and the desert in a few generations sweep
away the traces of man’s unworthy occupation. It is well worth the
hearty and undivided support of public-spirited men. For without just
such Conservation the time will come when our country will be unable
to support its own people; the diminishing percentage of its population
engaged in tilling the land will still further decline; and it will scarcely
be worth while to consider how best human life may be prolonged and
made sturdier and wholesomer physically by vital Conservation, because
it will lack the sustenance that it can not longer draw in sufficient quantity
and quality from nature’s withered breasts.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Paper, “War is the Policy of Waste”</span></h3>
<p class="center"><em>WAR, THE POLICY OF WASTE—PEACE, THE POLICY OF CONSERVATION.</em></p>

<p class="center">Mrs. <span class="smcap">Elmer Black</span>, New York City.</p>

<p>In advancing some arguments bearing on that broad assertion permit
me at the outset to express my satisfaction that the questions this Congress
has set itself to consider have come to be recognized as among the
most urgent of all the world’s humanitarian problems. For the peace
movement and the Conservation movement are as closely interrelated as,
in the pacifist view, the interests of the entire human race are mutual
and not antagonistic. The advance of your program is the advance of
ours; both are essential to the progress of mankind.</p>

<p>I do not suppose any one will cavil at my plea that when we talk of
natural resources we must not merely include inanimate things—timber,
minerals, lands, oil and waters—but the brain and sinews of the
people as well.</p>

<p>An observant traveler in the United States, asked recently what he
considered the greatest asset of the American nation, replied: “The
American nation itself, with its self-reliance, ingenuity, the blended
genius resulting from race fusion, and the boundless belief in its ability<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
to reach any goal it sets out to attain.” With that contention in mind,
I would at once emphasize the fact that neither the material resources of
the world nor these higher resources of human equipment can be utilized
or developed to their full complement till the profligate policy of international
strife is purged from the activities of mankind.</p>

<p>I venture to assert that no war can be waged today that can be justified
ethically or economically. With the bringing together of the civilizations
of the world, the development ever closer of the bonds of communication,
and the institution of the International Court of Arbitration,
the last excuse of the war makers has disappeared. No nation
today need go to war if the cause it advocates is just. When the plea of
“questions of national honor” is advanced it will usually be found that
the case behind the plea is so faulty as to entail risk if presented to the
judgment of an impartial tribunal, or that there is the secret reason of
a desire for aggression in order that some other nation may be robbed of
territory.</p>

<p>But assuming for the sake of argument that this latter case can be
justified on the ground of imperial advancement and the “survival of
the fittest”—a conclusion I do not in reality concede—I still contend
that war is a ghastly blunder, inevitably inflicting such loss to the treasuries
alike of victor and vanquished that both are laden with debts so
great that generations yet unborn are foredoomed to carry an unnatural
charge.</p>

<p>It requires no casuist to demonstrate that such a policy is detrimental
to human progress and diametrically opposed to thrifty administration.
If we think for a moment of what might be accomplished if the war
expenditures of nations were devoted to the proper development of the
world’s bountiful stores of wealth, the advancement of health and science
and the promotion of communal betterment, the imagination reels at the
vista of progress that is opened up.</p>

<p>Let us take a few comparisons. The Panama Canal, uniting two
oceans and bringing into closer contact the peoples of East and West,
is being constructed at a cost of $400,000,000. Against that accomplishment
set down the blood and treasure poured out in reckless waste in the
Crimean, South African and the Russo-Japanese wars. On the one
hand we have a constructive policy in which the nation’s toil and money
is conserved and invested so as to operate at compound interest for the
benefit not only of American citizens but also of the whole human race.
On the other hand, there is a destructive and prodigal policy that has
disappointed in after days even those most closely concerned with the
crimson fruits of victory.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Crimean War, Lord Salisbury, the late Premier of
England, said in his cynical way, “We put our money on the wrong
horse.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span></p>

<p>The South African War cost no less than $1,331,655,000 and added
no less than $795,880,000 to the national debt of England. The flower
of British manhood perished on the veldt that the Dutchmen of the
Transvaal might be forever relegated to the strata of the subjugated.
Yet today, a few short years after that deadly struggle, South Africa is
united; the Dutch are enjoying self-government, and, in fact, are politically
in the ascendant over their nominal rulers.</p>

<p>Russia lost her entire fleet, wrecked her army and set the forces of
internal discontent seething once more within her boundaries. Japan,
the nominal victor, so poured forth her wealth that even her amazing
vitality is shackled by the bonds of financial stringency. Today both are
suffering from the gigantic, blundering conflict—and in the end are compelled
peacefully to agree to recognize their respective interests in Northern
Asia.</p>

<p>England’s naval expenditure amounts to nearly $250,000,000 a year,
and every ten years great costly Dreadnoughts are thrown on the scrap
heap—a total waste. Now England has spent on irrigation in India
$150,000,000, and I would ask your attention to the fact that this expenditure
has not only brought health and prosperity to hundreds of
thousands, reduced the dangers of famine and made the desert blossom
as the rose, but there is a profit on the capital invested of six and three-quarters
per cent.</p>

<p>Taking that as a specimen of contrasts, one is amazed at the mental
spectacle of the immense strides that could be made in the world’s prosperity
if the expenditure on war and preparations for war was devoted
to the Conservation and development of natural resources. The armed
peace in Europe in thirty-seven years has cost $150,000,000,000. Yet
there are resources waiting to be developed for the benefit of the struggling
millions who are crushed beneath the iron heel of Mars; there are
reeking human rookeries in the cities of Europe that are a menace to
the human race; there are schemes for waterways that would open up
wealth practically untapped, to the end that productive machinery
might be set in motion for the continual benefit of nations yet to come.</p>

<p>When a Dreadnought fires a single shot from its big guns as much
money is dispersed into the air as would pay a workman’s wages for three
years or secure a clever student’s college course for a full twelve months.
For every cruiser scrapped in naval frenzy a fully staffed scientific laboratory
could be run for years in conflict against man’s mortal enemies,
the disease bearing bacilli. For years the inventive faculties of the world
have been turned to the production of implements of death and destruction.
In a saner age of Conservation and peace this concentrated genius
will be focused on the preservation of life, the clothing of the desert with
verdure, the elimination of space, the improvement of communications,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
the harnessing of natural forces to the service of man that even today
are seen but as through a glass, darkly.</p>

<p>The world is spending every year eight billion dollars on militarism.
The expenditure of that ocean of treasure leads nowhere but to the slippery
slope of bankruptcy. It creates nothing by which future generations
will benefit or of which any but the superficial can be proud. It
robs the treasury of the busy bees of commerce and industry and withdraws
from active participation in constructive affairs seventeen million
men, the strongest and best types, whose brain and muscle should be used
for the advancement of their kind. Women, in consequence, as in Germany,
have often to undertake work for which nature did not equip them,
and so a double wrong is wrought upon the human race.</p>

<p>If the interest only on the money spent on militarism were used on
education, 32,000,000 more students would be accommodated at college
every year; or the housing problem of every land could be solved as if
by a magic wand, to the immeasurable conservation of human health and
vigor.</p>

<p>During the South African War the “Investors’ Review” of London
said: “In one short eighteen months the war party now sitting on our
necks has dissipated more money than the working class managed to accumulate
out of their wages during the whole sixty-four years of the
reign of Queen Victoria.”</p>

<p>Chancellor Lloyd-George, as recently as the last budget, said in the
House of Commons that the money spent on building Dreadnoughts in
England in one year would add a dollar a week to the income of every
workingman’s family in Europe.</p>

<p>The United States, though not yet in the same parlous plight as the
European nations, is heading in that direction, and devotes the enormous
proportion of seventy per cent. of its national expenditure to preparations
for war. That is to say, every year we waste more than would
construct an epoch-making Panama Canal.</p>

<p>Were it possible immediately to reconstruct the scheme of things so
that reason ruled, there would be no need to cry aloud for the development
of the barren lands of our continent. Waterways would be extended,
irrigation works would carry the life-giving fluid to arid areas
that need but that to release their dormant fertility, herbage and fruit
would spring from regions now productive of only scrub and cacti, and
the reforestation of natural timber land would cause the birth of new
resources formerly despoiled by the ignorance and greed of man.</p>

<p>But, some may say, surely these shipyards, barracks, Dreadnoughts,
and war equipment circulate money and employ millions of men. That,
I contend, is a common fallacy a little thought will dissipate. Money
being but the tool used in the purchase of labor or the product of labor, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
in itself of no account. But the building of a Dreadnought to fire away
the product of labor in thin air is to bring all that has gone to prepare
for that achievement to nought. The chain of production is broken;
henceforth mankind is so much the worse off for that loss of money, labor
and its products. But in the true conservation of resources, the labor
and its products employed in peaceful and constructive enterprises
achieve benefits that flow on continuously in an ever-widening stream, till
the entire humanity is made to feel the blending of each man’s labor in
the commonweal.</p>

<p>Brain, sinew, time, energy and material resources are being thrown
into the melting pot of war, yet but for that very war the evolution of
the human race would be eons further on.</p>

<p>Every time a war scare sends the exchanges of the world’s capitals
into panic, deadly injury is done to the commerce of the entire globe.
Ruin has not to wait for the actual outbreak of hostilities. The wolf of
war has but to bare his fangs in menace to cause a premonitory slump
to spread devastation through the ranks of the investors. Yet instead of
meeting, as the delegates of this Congress are meeting, to debate the best
methods of insuring national and international thrift, in statesmanlike
preparation for the future needs of the human race, many powerful
minds are spending their time devising nightmares with which to scare
humanity into ruinous expenditure.</p>

<p>I venture to predict that in the future it will be found that the chief
instrument of Conservation has been established already in the arbitration
court at The Hague, and generations yet to come will say of its
founders, “They builded better than they knew.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the omens are favorable for the causes of peace and Conservation.
The object lessons are there for all the world to see. I have
mentioned the Panama Canal in the Western Hemisphere as an instance
of constructive Conservation. The Eastern Hemisphere also has its encouragement.
Right in the reputed cradle of the human race some of
the world’s most brilliant engineers are executing works that will unchain
rivers and cleave through mountains to the end that on Mesopotamia’s
broad lands the Garden of Eden shall be re-established.</p>

<p>I rejoice to know that this movement towards Conservation nowhere
has attained greater volume than in our own land; for with our advantages
it seems to me that we are specially equipped for the ennobling task
of removing obstacles from the path along which our race must tread in
the accomplishment of its high destiny.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Address, “The Conservation of Navigable Streams”</span></h3>
<p class="center"><em>THE CONSERVATION OF NAVIGABLE STREAMS.</em></p>

<p class="center">Mr. <span class="smcap">Jacob P. Dunn</span>, Indianapolis.</p>

<p>The objects of the conservation of natural resources divide naturally
into two classes. The first relates to the development of lands in private
ownership, such as the encouragement of forestation and renewing
the fertility of the soil, in which the interest of the State is the indirect
one of increasing the supply, or cheapening the cost of products that are
of material benefit to the entire community. The second relates to the
preservation and utilization of public property, such as forest lands and
mineral resources, in which the State has the direct interest of securing
special revenues, whereby the burdens of taxation may be reduced, and
of promoting the public welfare by furnishing facilities for commerce
and industry. To this second class belongs the conservation of navigable
streams, and this subject has already been brought prominently before
the public by the discussion of proposals for improvement of the navigation
of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. But this Mississippi
project has a vastly greater significance than the general public has fully
considered; for it means that hundreds of streams that are now navigated
only in a small way, or not navigated at all, will later be made navigable
in a practical and useful way.</p>

<p>Moreover, this subject is of special importance to the great region
formerly included in the territory northwest of the Ohio River, including
the present States of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin,
because the Ordinance of 1787, by which that territory was created,
expressly provided that: “The navigable waters leading into the Mississippi
and St. Lawrence, and the carrying places between the same, shall
be common highways, and forever free, as well to the inhabitants of the
said territory as to the citizens of the United States, and those of any
other States that may be admitted into the confederacy, without any tax,
duty, or impost therefor.”</p>

<p>These words show that the word “navigable” was not then used in its
present common acceptation. When we speak of a navigable stream we
commonly mean one that can be navigated by steamboats, but there were
no steamboats in 1787, and all of the commercial navigation of this region
at that time was by means of canoes and the small vessels known as
bateaux and pirogues. That this navigation was what was intended is
conclusively shown by the reservation of “the carrying places,” i. e., the
stretches of watershed between the headwaters of the streams of the two
drainage systems over which both the boats and their loads were transported
bodily. This meaning has usually been adhered to by the courts
(2 Mich. 219; 19 Oregon, 375; 33 W. Virginia 13; 20 Barbour, N. Y., 9;
14 Ky., 521; 87 Wis. 134), and the general rule is that any stream that
will carry commerce, even by floating logs, is a navigable stream. (51
Illinois, 266; 42 Wis. 203.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span></p>

<p>The United States Government followed out this theory consistently.
By the act of Congress of 1796, for the survey and sale of the public
lands of this region, it was expressly declared that “all navigable streams
within the territory to be disposed of by virtue of this act shall be
deemed to be and remain public highways.” As such their beds were
always excluded from the lands surveyed and sold. The government
surveyors did not include any of the larger streams in their surveys,
but “meandered” them, and when the land was sold, it was sold in
fractional sections, running to the meander lines. The beds of the
streams and the land bordering them was thus reserved as public property,
and when the several States were formed and admitted to the
Union, the title was transferred to them from the general government.
It is of course to be remembered that Congress has ultimate power over
navigable streams, but it is well established law that a State has plenary
power over navigable streams that are entirely within its borders, at
least until Congress acts.</p>

<p>The acceptance of this provision as to navigable streams was made a
prerequisite to the admission of Indiana to the Union by the enabling
act of 1816. It was formerly accepted by ordinance of the constitutional
convention of Indiana in 1816. And yet Indiana stands today in the
unique position of being the only State in the Northwest in which the
public rights thus established have been nullified, or at least clouded, by
an absurd decision of the Supreme Court of the State, made in 1876.
(54 Ind. 471.) Inasmuch as this case deals with White River in Marion
County, and as this stream at this point furnishes a typical illustration
of the whole subject, I will call your attention to it in detail.</p>

<p>Prior to this decision, every department of the government of Indiana
fully recognized the binding force of this compact with the United States,
and accepted as conclusive the United States surveys in the determination
of what streams were navigable under that compact. The bed of
White River in Marion County was not included in these surveys, and it
was never sold by the United States or by the State. The Legislature
of Indiana always recognized this rule, and always applied it to “White
River in Marion County.” The act of January 17, 1820, declared White
River navigable as high as “the Delaware towns,” meaning presumably
to Muncie, and made it and the other streams named “public highways,”
making it a penal offense to obstruct “any stream declared navigable by
this act,” except only that mill-dams might be erected under certain
conditions, by persons who had “purchased from the United States the
bed of any stream by this act declared navigable.” This law was never
repealed, but was modified by the act of February 10, 1831, which declared
White River navigable as high as Yorktown in Delaware County.
This last law is notable as recognizing that a stream need not be navigable
at all seasons, for it prohibited any obstruction that would “injure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</span>
or impede the navigation of any stream, reserved by the ordinance of
Congress of 1787 as a public highway, at a stage of water when it would
otherwise be navigable.”</p>

<p>Indianapolis was located on this stream because it was navigable for
the water-craft then in use. The Legislature of 1825, on petition from
the people of Indianapolis, made Alexander Ralston a commissioner to
survey the stream, and report on the probable expense of keeping it free
from obstruction. He made the survey that summer, and reported the
distance from Sample’s Mills, in Randolph County, to Indianapolis, 130
miles; from here to the forks, 285 miles; from there to the Wabash, 40
miles, and that for this distance of 455 miles the stream could be made
navigable for three months in the year by an expenditure of $1,500. He
found two falls or rapids, one of eighteen inches, eight miles above Martinsville,
and one of nine feet in about one hundred yards, ten miles
above the forks.</p>

<p>On this report, the Legislature on January 21, 1826, passed a law to
improve the navigation of White River as high as Sample’s Mills, in
Randolph County, directing that all persons liable for road work living
within two miles of the stream, in the counties bordering on the stream,
be called out to improve the stream as a highway. This law was made
general by the act of May 31, 1852, which empowered county boards to
declare streams navigable, and to work them as highways; and this act
is still continued in force by the act of April 15, 1905. (Burns’ Stats.,
Sec. 7672.)</p>

<p>The act of January 28, 1828, appropriated $1,000 for improving the
navigation of White River as high as Anderson, in Madison County. The
act of January 23, 1829, “relative to navigable streams declared highways
by the ordinance of Congress of 1787,” prohibited any obstruction
of any stream or river “which is navigable, and the bed or channel of
which has not been surveyed or sold as land by the United States.” So
the law of 1852 made it a penal offense to obstruct “any navigable
stream, the bed or channel whereof may not have been surveyed or sold
by the United States.” (Rev. Stats. 1852, Vol. 2, p. 432.) This is continued
in force, in the same language, by the act of April 15, 1905.
(Burns’ Stat., Sec. 2650.)</p>

<p>The executive department never questioned the correctness of this
rule, and some of the Governors took a great deal of interest in the
matter. After the general introduction of steamboat navigation, Governor
Noble was ambitious to add that to the ordinary commerce by
flatboats and keel boats, and in 1828 he offered a reward of $200 to the
first captain who would bring a steamboat to this point, and also to sell
his cargo free of charge. In pursuance of this a small steamboat from
Cincinnati was actually brought up the river to Indianapolis in 1831.
The early courts also recognized the rule that the survey and sale of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
bed of a stream was the conclusive test of its navigability, under the
law. (3 Blackf. 193.) The State asserted actual ownership of the bed
of the stream in this county, and for years maintained an agent at the
Washington street crossing to sell sand and gravel from it on the State’s
account.</p>

<p>In the face of all this, when the question came before the Supreme
Court, in 1876, the court, by Judge Perkins, without any real examination
of the law or the facts, said: “The court knows judicially, as a
matter of fact, that White River, in Marion County, is neither a navigated
nor a navigable stream”; and as to the bed not being surveyed
or sold he said: “The idea that the power was given to a surveyor, or
his deputy, upon casual observation, to determine the question of the
navigability of rivers, and thereby conclude vast public and private
rights, is an absurdity.” On this assumption he proceeded to wipe the
“vast public rights” out of existence. A little examination would have
shown him that the surveys were not irresponsible acts of the surveyors,
but official acts in pursuance of law, under the direction of superior
officers, and confirmed and ratified not only by those superiors, but by
the United States and the State of Indiana. (54 Ind. 471.)</p>

<p>The court abandoned the reasoning of this case two years later, when
it held that the Wabash River, in Warren County, was “a navigable
stream, the bed of which has neither been surveyed nor sold.” (64 Ind.
162.) But it cited the decision of 1876 as authoritative in another case
in 1900 (155 Ind. 477), and this again without any examination of the
law or the facts. It is worthy of note that the United States Government
has uniformly declined to recognize this decision as law, and as late as
1899 refused to be bound by it. (Indianapolis News, November 7, 1899.)</p>

<p>Fortunately, opportunity has arisen for a reconsideration of this
question in a case arising in the Kankakee swamp lands (State vs. Tuesbury
Land Co., Starke Circuit Court). In the northern end of Indiana,
particularly near the Kankakee River, there was a large amount of
swamp land which was not included in the United States surveys nor
sold by the United States. This was transferred to the State many
years ago, and part of it was reclaimed and sold by the State. In 1891
reclamation was entered on a large scale by removing the ledge of rock
at Momence, Illinois, which dammed the Kankakee, and caused most of
those swamps. As soon as these lands were drained, adjacent owners
set up claims to the thread of the stream as riparian owners, and a judgment
was obtained in the Starke Circuit Court upholding such claims.
If valid this means that the great expense to which the State has gone
in reclaiming the lands is money thrown away.</p>

<p>As soon as he learned of it, Governor Marshall, who is very practical
in his statesmanship, directed the Attorney-General to take steps to
secure a reversal of the judgment or appeal it, and a new trial has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
secured in the case, which is to be heard shortly. The Kankakee is one
of the most noted of the streams referred to in the Ordinance of 1787
as “navigable waters,” which are reserved forever as “public highways,”
and there should be no riparian rights in it.</p>

<p>There is certainly good reason to expect a reversal of the Indiana
decision, if not by our Supreme Court, by the Supreme Court of the
United States, for two special reasons: (1) The question of the navigability
of a stream is not primarily a judicial question, but one of public
policy to be determined by the legislative department, and both
Congress and our State Legislature have consistent records for the navigability
of these streams. (2) In this case the navigability is a matter
of solemn compact between the State and the United States; and as
the constitutions of both prohibit any law impairing the obligation of a
contract, it is hardly to be assumed that the courts would undertake to
annul a contract of this character.</p>

<p>Unquestionably White River, like most of the other streams of Indiana,
is not as practically navigable today as it was eighty years ago, and
for two very simple reasons. First, at that time the only timber that got
into the river was trees on the bank that were thrown in by the banks
caving, and these were usually held to the banks by their roots. But
after settlement began every freshet carried quantities of logs, rails and
boards down the river, to form drifts; and these in turn caused the
formation of sand and gravel bars. Second, when the land was cleared
and cultivated, the ground washed much more readily than it did before,
and much greater quantities of sand and gravel were carried into the
river to form bars. These bars constitute the chief obstruction to practical
navigation now.</p>

<p>But by a change in recent conditions of life, these bars furnish the
means for making the river practically navigable. Within the last two
decades there has grown up a special demand for this sand and gravel;
and especially has this demand been increased by the call for good roads;
for washed gravel is one of the best materials available for road-making,
and by these streams, nature has distributed it very widely over the
State. This demand has developed the industry of removing sand and
gravel from the river beds by means of suction pumps, and since 1897,
when it began, this industry has reached proportions that are not generally
known to the public. At Indianapolis there have been six steam
pumps working for several years. They are mounted on scow boats,
fifty to sixty-five feet in length, and twenty to twenty-five feet in width,
and by centrifugal suction power, draw up a mixture of sand, gravel and
water through eight-inch pipes. The pipe entrance is screened to prevent
the entrance of stones over four or five inches in diameter, in order
to avoid clogging the pipe.</p>

<p>These six pumps take out 180,000 cubic yards of sand and gravel in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
a year, at a cost of 20 to 25 cents a cubic yard. The material is separated
by passing over screens into two grades of sand and two of
gravel, and is sold at a good profit for street improvement, roofing,
asphalt mixture, concrete, mortar and locomotive sand. Formerly Lake
Michigan sand was shipped here in considerable quantities, but now the
demand is fully met by this local industry. The pumps take out the
material for a depth of about fifteen feet, and in the course of their
work they have made about three miles of Indianapolis river front practically
navigable for any kind of river craft. The boats can easily be
run to any point on the river and used for removing bars at any place.
At present the proprietors of the boats are paying the adjacent landowners
for the privilege of taking out material that rightfully belongs to
the State, and of which the public ought to have the benefit.</p>

<p>The practical situation is this: Indiana has an almost inexhaustible
supply of the best and cheapest road material known, which rightfully
belongs to the State. By using this material it will make actually navigable
hundreds of miles of waterways that are now of no use in commerce.
It is quite common for the unthinking to joke about the absurdity
of making small streams navigable, but there is nothing absurd about it.
Over half a century ago Indiana constructed 453 miles of canal, at an
average cost of $15,000 a mile, which has since been practically abandoned,
not as is generally supposed, because of the competition of rail
roads, but because it was high line canal, and was built up, in part, instead
of being dug out, and without proper precaution for making it
water-tight. The State was not alone in its experience. There are in the
United States over 1,950 miles of abandoned high-line canal, that cost
over $44,000,000. But there are also plenty of low-line canals in practical
and profitable operation.</p>

<p>The mistake that was made in Indiana was in not utilizing the natural
water-courses. At an expense of less than $15,000 per mile, White
River can easily be made navigable for steamboats from Indianapolis to
its mouth, where there is actual steamboat navigation now. The fall in
the river is only 269 feet in the 285 miles, or less than a foot to the mile.
The tested flow of White River at this point is over 1,000 cubic feet per
second. With not to exceed half a dozen dams, and the principal bars
pumped out and put into roads, the thing is accomplished. Not only is
there nothing impracticable about it, but it is as certain to be done, in
the not distant future, as it is that the sun will rise tomorrow morning.
The advantages of water communication with the great coal and building
stone region of the State, as well as direct connection with the Wabash,
Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, is too obvious for discussion. With our
Supreme Court decisions put on a rational and just basis, there is nothing
to prevent a speedy accomplishment of the work.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Report from the National Fertilizer Association</span></h3>
<p class="center"><em>REPORT FROM THE NATIONAL FERTILIZER ASSOCIATION.</em></p>

<p class="center">Presented by Mr. <span class="smcap">John D. Toll</span>, Secretary of the Educational Bureau of the
National Fertilizer Association, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Charles S. Rauh</span>, of Indianapolis,
Official Delegates to the Fourth National Conservation Congress.</p>

<p>In the last analysis man must have food. The law of supply and
demand becomes operative the minute that a nation is born. Scarcity
of food produces abnormal prices. As scarcity increases, the prices become
almost prohibitive. The attention of every citizen of this country
has been called to the rapid increase in the cost of food products during
the last decade. This increase has been due to several causes, among
which we may note the following: (1) Increase of population has exceeded
the increase in production of foodstuffs; (2) scarcity of new
lands to be developed to meet the needs of a growing population; (3)
decrease in productivity of some of the formerly productive soils of this
country.</p>

<p>Other causes have undoubtedly contributed to this situation, but the
one pertinent to the present discussion is that of decreasing soil fertility
as it is related to the production of crops. The production of crops
depends (1) upon the fertility of the soil; (2) climatic conditions; (3)
quality of seed used; and (4) the culture and care given to the crop.
Three of these governing factors are under the control of the farmer.
Therefore, inasmuch as they are under his control, so also is the supply
of food under his control to an equal degree.</p>

<p>According to the latest available statistics, out of 1,755,132,800 acres
in the United States, there are 383,891,682 acres of improved land. A
considerable amount of this land is being used for the production of
crops of various kinds. These crops in 1911 totaled the enormous production
of $5,504,000,000.</p>

<p>The plant food consisting of nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash
which these crops take from the soil is not all returned to the land, and,
as a result, we have a yearly drain upon the fertility account of our
soils.</p>

<p>The loss of all three essential elements of plant food is being partly
met by the wise Conservation and use of barn manure.</p>

<p>The loss of nitrogen in this depletion is also being partly met by the
growing of legumes which have the power of taking nitrogen from the
air and fixing it in the soil where it is available as plant food.</p>

<p>If any one of these elements is lacking, crop production suffers a
decrease in quantity and a deterioration in quality, to wit: If phosphoric
acid is the lacking element in soil, the production of ear corn may
be large in quantity but the ears are soft and immature, consequently are
inferior for stock food or for human food. In the same way a scarcity
of phosphoric acid decreases the yield of wheat and causes an inferiority
in its quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span></p>

<p>The lack of nitrogen and potash has equally disastrous effects on the
production of the crop. It is, therefore, not only a supply of plant food
that is necessary, but the balancing of it in order that our soil may produce
a maximum crop of best quality. The fertilizer industry is an industry
engaged entirely in the supply of these plant food elements. It
is, therefore, a direct contributor to the maintenance of the human race,
in that it deals in the elements of plant food.</p>

<p>Not only since its inception in 1840 has this industry contributed to
the supply of plant food, which in the end means human food, but it
has noted the wasteful methods of agriculture being practiced, unconsciously
frequent, in many parts of this country, and it has put forth
continuous efforts along the lines of educating the American farmer to
grow larger yields of better crops, to maintain and increase the fertility
of the soil, and increase the average yield per acre.</p>

<p>The fertilizer industry has, through its national association, within
the past two years established several movements, the great purpose of
which is to assist in the dissemination of knowledge of modern methods
of agriculture.</p>

<p>Another line of effort wherein the fertilizer industry has been a
direct contributor to the conservation of vital resources is in its great
manufacturing plants. To produce the phosphoric acid which is supplied
in fertilizers, the industry obtains the barren phosphatic rock from
Tennessee, Carolinas, Florida, etc., grinds this material and treats it
chemically so as to make the phosphoric acid available. By this means,
it supplies to the great crop producing States of this country the element
of plant food, which, to a large extent, determines the maturity and quality
of crop production.</p>

<p>The industry also takes the waste material of the packing houses, such
as bone, offal, blood, etc., dries and grinds it and produces an ingredient
of fertilizers which was formerly thrown away. This packing house material
supplies nitrogen and phosphoric acid.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the garbage of the cities and towns of this country is
collected and reduced to the form of fertilizer ingredient, where it
formerly was burned or otherwise destroyed.</p>

<p>Not only is all this done, but the former waste products of the cotton
and tobacco industry are similarly reduced to a form of plant food to be
mixed with other materials and returned to the soil.</p>

<p>Still further, besides gathering up the waste and otherwise barren
products of the country, the industry has developed processes whereby
the gases from gas and coke manufacture are collected and reduced to
sulphate of ammonia in which form it constitutes one of the nitrogenous
ingredients in fertilizers. This ammonia sulphate is used as an ingredient
in fertilizers supplying nitrogen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span></p>

<p>Of late years the industry has gone even further than this, in that
a process has been discovered whereby the nitrogen of the air is harnessed,
and the product reduced to such forms that it supplies available
nitrogen for plant food.</p>

<p>In assembling and preparing these essential elements of plant food,
the industry, as we have pointed out, not only prepares material to return
to the soil to supply the elements which have been taken out of it,
but it actually provides in deficient soils elements in which they may be
deficient, and by so doing makes more productive lands which, on account
of their balanced plant food, could not produce paying results before
being treated.</p>

<p>The State of Georgia in 1911 spent over twenty million dollars for
fertilizers, with the result that they raised more and better cotton than
was ever raised in this State before. The State of Maine in the same
year used 150,000 tons of fertilizers on their potato fields, with the result
that their good potato growers produced from two to four hundred bushels
of potatoes per acre. The total State productions exceed 25,000,000
bushels.</p>

<p>The fertilizer industry, we believe, occupies a most prominent part
in the problem of producing sustenance for future generations and in
conserving the vital resources of the world, inasmuch as it is making a
close study of and doing a wonderful work in devising means whereby
practically all of the former waste materials of this country may be
reduced to available plant food and returned to the soil from which
they were taken.</p>

<p>Summarizing, the fertilizer industry, as we have pointed out, is an
important factor in the maintenance of the human race, of this and other
continents, in that (1) it supplies plant food to balance up the plant food
in the soil and to make up the deficiencies which have occurred as a result
of continuous cropping; (2) assists in educating the farmers to conserve
the fertility of their soils by employing scientific methods of farming;
(3) it makes use of waste products of other industries which have formerly
been destroyed, and returns them to the soil in the form
of food for future crops.</p>

<p>The fertilizer industry, therefore, must be recognized as one of the
greatest agencies of conservation of vital resources.</p>

<h3><span class="hidden">Dr. W. J. McGee: An Appreciation of His Services for Conservation</span></h3>
<p class="center"><em>DR. W J McGEE: AN APPRECIATION OF HIS SERVICES
FOR CONSERVATION.</em></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. W. C. Mendenhall</span>, Washington, D. C.</p>

<p>Dr. W J McGee had mastered and advocated the fundamental principles
of Conservation long before the majority of those now most active
in the movement had come to appreciate the real meaning of the word.
He was one of the founders of this movement, was at all times one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
the most stimulating thinkers in its councils, and in him Mr. Pinchot
found one of his most loyal supporters and friends. Doctor McGee was
the personification of strength and steadfastness in the pioneer period of
Conservation, when the meaning of the word was unknown to the multitude,
and when the mere suggestion that our natural resources are not
inexhaustible but may be depleted to the vanishing point by wasteful use
was regarded as a wild heresy. During the preceding sessions of this
Congress he was its accepted authority on problems involving that most
widespread and universally distributed of our natural resources—water.
He has dealt with this resource from the points of view of transportation,
of irrigation, and of power, and from the standpoint of biology in which
it is recognized as fundamental in all life.</p>

<p>Doctor McGee’s mind was of the type of the intellectual pioneer, intensely
individual and original. He was masterful in the alignment of
facts and stimulating in the recognition and boldness of his expression of
the generalizations and far-reaching conclusions to which his marshalled
facts pointed. Like most men of brilliant imagination, he was at times
impatient of the slow processes of research, or let us say rather that his
impatience was with that timidity in reaching conclusions so often displayed
by those engaged in research, rather than with the process itself.
He believed that the scientist’s practical rule of life should be the acceptance,
as a basis of action, of the conclusions indicated by such facts as
are known, even though those conclusions may not at present be definitely
established.</p>

<p>Doctor McGee’s death at the Cosmos Club on September 4, 1912, removed
from the domain of science and from the forum of public discussion
one of its leading personalities. His career embraced an unusually
wide range of activities and in each of these he attained distinction. As
a geologist he was one of the group assembled by Major Powell during
the formative period of the United States Geological Survey, a group
which made American geology classic and its leaders world-leaders in
their science. In this field McGee’s name is associated with the names of
Powell, Dutton, Gilbert, Holmes, Emmons, and Hague. Later, with the
establishment of the Bureau of Ethnology, into which he followed Major
Powell, he became a pioneer in ethnological research, although retaining
continually his interest in geologic and geographic problems. At the
time of his death and for a few years prior thereto he was the erosion
and hydrologic expert of the Department of Agriculture, his immediate
connection with that department being through the Bureau of Soils.
His last years are distinguished by a number of papers on the subject of
Conservation, in which he was so vitally interested; these articles are
broad in their scope, thoroughly original and stimulating in their expression,
and point out fearlessly some dangers of present practice and suggest
methods of remedy. But a few days before his death he completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
the correction of the galley proofs of the last of his papers, faithful to
his work and to his duty even while descending into the Valley of the
Shadow.</p>

<p>This very brief sketch would not be complete without expressed recognition
of the fact that Doctor McGee’s attitude in the face of death
was in accordance with the best traditions of the science to which his
life had been devoted and was as admirable and as deeply stirring and
stimulating as any act of his career. For a year or more he had recognized
the fact that he was afflicted with cancer and that his days were
numbered. He faced this fact calmly and prepared patiently for the
inevitable by carefully completing all work on hand and by disposing
by will of his body and his brain to his friend and fellow scientist, Dr.
Spitska, to be used in the way most likely to be beneficial to humanity.
So long as his faculties remained undimmed, he maintained the same
keen interest in scientific questions and current affairs that had marked
his career at its height. Those of his friends who visited him during
the last few weeks of his life heard not a single complaint nor an expression
of regret, but found themselves chatting easily with an old and honored
friend who gave no indication of the fact that he knew definitely
that his career was soon to be stayed by the hand of Death. Thus,
rising superior to the weakened, pain-racked body, he met with philosophic
calm and sublime courage the final inevitable test. It is not
given to man to do more than this.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
